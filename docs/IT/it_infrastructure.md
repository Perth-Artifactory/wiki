[IT GOVERNANCE](/subcommittee/it_infrastructure/it_governance)

#### Standards

[SETUP STANDARDS](/subcommittee/it_infrastructure_setup_standards)

Most Artifactory equipment needs to be setup in a specific way. Here you can find guides on how on what software or configurations should be used to make sure you are setting things up for the best result (and to work with everything else!)

[Network Address Allocations](/subcommittee/it_infrastructure/setup_standards/ip_ranges)

The Artifactry IP range is split into sections for device types. Before configuring a new device for a [statically mapped](/subcommittee/it_infrastructure/setup_standards/static_map) address please make sure you check the [allocation table](/subcommittee/it_infrastructure/setup_standards/ip_ranges) and use the right range
