# Laptop Docks
There are two laptop docks in the design lab.

## Lenovo Dock
![img_1788.jpg](/docs/IT/img_1788.jpg =400x)
The Lenovo Dock is setup alongside the workstation on the left. This is a USB dock that does not use Thunderbolt. This means it can work with laptops that do not have Thunderbolt, including those without USB-C. To make this work, it uses a software called DisplayLink.
This can be downloaded here: https://www.synaptics.com/products/displaylink-graphics/downloads

As there is still a PC in place sharing those screens, the dock does not have a keyboard and mouse connected. You will need to either use your laptop’s keyboard and mouse or BYO.

The dock does support up to 90W charging over USB-C but will not provide charging when using the USB-C to A adaptor on the end of the cable

To use the dock:
1.	Install DisplayLink software
2.	Plug laptop into dock
3.	Set left screen to DVI and right screen to VGA (Analog)

When finished with the dock:
The screens do not reliably switch back to the PC input. Use the input select button to change the screens back to the original settings for using the PC (left VGA (Analog) and right DVI)
