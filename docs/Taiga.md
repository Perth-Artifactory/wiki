The Artifactory uses a project management tool ([Taiga](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au)) to:

* Track the progress of subcommittee projects *e.g. tool commissioning*
* Track repairs to Artifactory tools, equipment, and infrastructure
* Provide oversight for bureaucratic workflows like requesting a locker, applying for a key, or reporting an injury.

You are welcome to [sign up to our Taiga instance](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/register) and join our public boards. (Infrastructure and Laser subcommittees)

## For attendees and members

Forms can be filled out by typing `/form` in any Slack channel.

You can use this interface to:

* Report an injury or near miss
* Let the committee know when you've found the workshop in an unclean state
* Report a broken 3D printer to our printer volunteers
* Report a broken laser cutter to our laser volunteers
* Report a broken/damaged tool/equipment/piece of infrastructure
* Request a member storage locker
* Apply for a 24/7 key

## For people looking for something to do

The whiteboard in the space is the primary method of tracking things that need to be done in the space on a regular basis. e.g. taking out the bins.

Taiga is the primary method of tracking once off items you can do to help that may need more detail.

The easiest way to get to Taiga the first time is to search in Slack.

Once you've opened the Home tab of the Taiga app you should see a list of tasks assigned to our "whiteboard". You can use the view buttons to find out more information about a task, including who to talk to if you have more questions.

## For ongoing volunteers

The onboarding process for ongoing volunteers is fairly simple:

* [Sign up to our Taiga instance](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/register). Preferrably with the same email address you use for TidyHQ though this is not a requirement.
* Reach out to #it or the relevant/appropriate subcommittees to get access to the boards you need.
* Start putting your hand up for items or have them delegated to you.

As a Taiga user you're able to edit/create items for the boards you're a member of.

You can also raise items based on messages sent anywhere within Slack. (Including DMs)
