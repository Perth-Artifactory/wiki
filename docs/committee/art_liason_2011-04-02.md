this week: made friends at Scitech - Claire (csiro lab manager) introduced me to Chris and Jessie who run the workshops and excursions. They are looking to book something for july? Brett and I are keen to take that on but there may be many more opportunities for all kinds of workshops. Met with Katie Lenanton (courtesy of Neil) who works for city council. She gave me lots of targeted, practical advice (and names) for publicising artifactory in the local art world. Also some tips on residency programs and funding. (i would like to discuss these/share details/numbers once i have had some sleep)

next week: Artist talk! sat 9th. Joey the prop/contraption-builder will be here for general hacking from around 1pm so it's an awesome time to invite friends to the space! I have not contacted sugar blue. Joey mentioned a friend of his, Sarah, that wanted to invite his whole workshop (15 people) to the talk - i will confirm with him Space needs another tidy (i know it's been mentioned a lot) i will be in during the week to shuffle stuff. Need a projector and sound for the talk Anyone got a favourite restaurant in innaloo?? i'll be looking at asian most likely - for the veg and gluten-free options.

Tonight i went to a friend's exhib opening and met the artist who did the giant billowing thing for st george's cathedral - will be talking to him about sculptural logistics but also use that opportunity to plug artifactory/ get more advice :D

sorry if that made no sense, i'd like to discuss more next week. questions, comments, advice are all good!
