The Perth Artifactory is a nonprofit organization run entirely by volunteers and thrives through the overall communal and combined effort of its members. Unfortunately this means we aren't open every day. You can find our opening hours on [Google Maps](https://g.page/theperthartifactory).

## Member RFID Key Access

If you have a Full or Concession membership and meet a list of [requirements](/docs/policies/bylaws#rfid-keys-for-members) then you can opt to apply for a 24/7 access key. 
When doing so you will be required to pay a bond equal to three months of your membership fees.
You can apply for a key by submitting the appropriate form via Taiga on Slack (`Submit a form` > `Apply for a key`).

## Member Access

Members who have not paid for a key have a variety of methods to access the space.

### Webcams

Check the webcams to see if there is already a key holding member who has opened up and come down. Some members have opted in to the presence list at the bottom of the page. If one of these members is in the space you can also usually message them on Slack to check how long they'll be sticking around. However, we require a keyholder to be present any time there are people in the workshop. This means that if the last keyholder wants to leave they'll let you know \~15 minutes beforehand to give you time to pack up.

> In this context opening up the space means leaving the front door open. Keyholders are welcome to use the workshop without opening the space and are not obligated to do so.

### Regular Events

Come down on one of our regular scheduled events. You're welcome to attend the events but you can also just go off and do your own thing or use what you need to.

### Organise with a member

> Your success organising access with a member is going to vary greatly depending on:
> What you want to do - Is it loud tools that need supervision from the keyholder?
> Your relationship with the keyholder in question - Have they met you before?
{.is-warning}

Go to our [Slack team](https://perart.io/slack) ask if anyone will be in at the space on a particular day or time.

* Our primary real time communication method is Slack and will yield the best results.
* The #memberavailability channel or #general channel are the best places to ask.

## Casual Access

Casual visiting members who just want to use the tools for the day/night are limited to event times, other than by special arrangement.
