## Scope

This document is intended to cover loans of tools by an individual (“tool owner”) to the Association (Perth Artifactory Inc., "The Association").

"Tools" includes all types of tools and equipment, including -

* hand tools,
* power tools,
* electronic equipment,
* machinery, and
* accessories or attachments to equipment.

## Approvals

An agreement made using this document must be -

* approved in writing by a member of the Infrastructure Subcommittee, and
* seconded in writing by either -
  * another member of the Infrastructure Subcommittee, or
  * a member of the Management Committee.

This agreement may be varied with the approval of all parties.

## Record keeping

Written records must be made of:

* The tool owner's name, and
* The approver's and seconder's names, and
* The tool owner's contact details, and
* The tool which is being loaned, and any accessories and attachments included, and
* Any variations to the standard loan agreement.

## Artifactory obligations

* The Association is not liable for damages to the tool. 
  * The Association will endeavour to identify who caused damage to the tool. 
  * The Association will attempt to investigate and correct any systematic causes for damage to the tool.
  * The Management Committee may hold members liable for damage to the tool, where it is determined that the damage was due to the negligence of a member.
    * This determination will be made by the Management Committee, assisted by the Infrastructure Subcommittee.
* The Association is not responsible for maintenance costs associated with the tool.
* The Association may request that the tool be removed from the space at any time.
  * The Management Committee must give the tool owner reasonable notice that reflects the difficulty of relocating the tool. The notice does not need to reflect the tool owner’s alternative storage options.
  * The notice period must be at least 14 days for hand/power tools and at least 28 days for other equipment.
  * If the tool is not removed within the notice period, the tool will be treated as a donation to The Association.
* The Association may opt to implement a tool usage fee for the tool to reflect power usage, workshop usage, and other costs determined by the Management Committee.
* The Association Infrastructure Subcommittee may gate a loaned tool behind a safety induction.
  * In the event that a safety induction is in place the tool owner does not automatically have the ability to induct users.
* The Association must not modify the tool without explicit agreement of the tool owner.
* The Association must contact the tool owner via the contact details designated by the tool owner.

## Owner obligations

* The tool owner must maintain exclusive, free and clear ownership of the tool.
* The tool owner must keep their contact details up to date.
* The Association will assume liability in place of the tool owner if a user is injured using the tool.
  * This provision applies to the extent that the event is covered under an insurance policy held by the Association.
* If the tool is damaged in a manner that is covered by an insurance policy held by the Association, the Association will pay the policy excess.
* The tool owner may freely modify the tool, provided that the modification -
  * is appropriately documented and communicated to members,
  * does not reduce safety protections on the tool,
  * does not increase the risk associated with the tool,
  * does not increase the footprint of the tool, and
  * does not incur increased financial obligations for the Association
* The tool owner will be subject to the tool usage fee, if any.
  * If there are multiple rates of tool usage fee deliniated by membership class the tool owner will always be subject to the lowest applicable rate.
* The tool owner may end the loan by providing written notice to the Management Committee.
  * The notice must be at least 14 days for hand/power tools and at least 28 days for other equipment, unless a suitable replacement is already available.
  * The notice period may be waived by a member of the Infrastructure Subcommittee or the Management Committee.
* The tool owner may temporarily remove the tool by request.
  * The request must be approved by a member of the Infrastructure Subcommittee or the Management Committee.
  * Approval must not be unreasonably withheld. A reasonable example of why a request may be denied is a scheduled upcoming event that requires the tool.
