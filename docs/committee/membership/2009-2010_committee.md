#### Venue

-   [2010 New Venue Search](/committee/2010_New_Venue_Search/start) - It seems like we may have to move. No definite push from the town of Vincent, but the problems of power, noise, parking and zoning are only going to get worse, so perhaps we should take the plunge. This is the start of a discussion on what sort of space we should be looking for.
