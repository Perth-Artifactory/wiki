# Bank Transfer

The Artifactory can accept electronic funds transfer to the following account:  
\*\*Bank: \*\* National Australia Bank  
**Account Name:** Perth Artifactory Inc.  
\*\*BSB: \*\* 086-366  
\*\*Account Number: \*\* 165 469 448  
\*\*Payment Reference: \*\* "YOUR NAME" as shown in TidyHQ **or** "Invoice reference number"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**MEMBERSHIP PAYMENTS**

**When  
** If you are going to pay by EFT please setup it up as a regular bank transfer. (ie Same time each month) Ideally the same day as your next membership period starts.

For example: If your membership runs 6th-5th of the following month, then pay on the 6th. If you are unsure as to what date to pay, contact the Treasurer.

**Receipts  
** will be sent from TidyHQ within two weeks of receiving payment. Until you have received this receipt your membership status in TidyHQ will show as "Partial". This will change to "Active" once a receipt is issued. (Both Active+Partial means you are currently a member.)

NOTE: YOU WILL STILL RECEIVE INVOICES ISSUED BY TIDYHQ IF PAYING BY REGULAR EFT AND NO ACTION IS REQUIRED BY YOU ON THESE.

**Questions?  
**Contact the Treasurer. \*\*treasurer@artifactory.org.au \*\*
