# Safer-space/Equal Opportunity Policy

## Poster Designs

#### Design 1

This hopefully not-too-garish design is meant to be vaguely reminiscent of earlier sci-fi/home-computing designs and evoke the rainbow motif of the various LGBTI movements without actually re-appropriating that symbol. The text reads:

> You are welcome here.

\>

> The Artifactory is an inclusive space that welcomes people of all ages, gender identities, ethnicities, sexual preferences, beliefs, abilities and appearances; we celebrate diversity and oppose any form of harassment or discrimination.

\>

> Please help to make the Artifactory an exciting, enjoyable and safer place by respecting the dignity and rights of your fellow members and visitors. If you have any questions, concerns or comments, you can speak to a member of the committee or email committee@artifactory.org.au.

\>

> Thank you.
>
> The Perth Artifactory
