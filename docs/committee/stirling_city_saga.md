-   2013:03:27-15:16pm - SKoT rang Geoff Wyber. Geoff said he was "just writing to us, what a coincidence". Indeed. He is sending letter to SKoT's home address with planning approval docs, Geoff will also scan and email to SKoT. Found out Peter Jaggard is from Health, direct number is 93458911, he works part time, and has our "File". Geoff suggested we hire a private surveyor to see what we need to do for public building approval. SKoT asked about whether we could run events in the meantime whilst approval was pending, Geoff wasn't concrete on issue (too many council departments in the mix, I think) but suggested we maybe shouldn't in case something went wrong and we were caught without approval. SKoT asked if we could get on with Public Building approval doc, Geoff said Peter would probably bounce it back to Zoning, which ideally would like to have public building approval. Argh, circular! SKoT ensures Geoff has Skot@vellocet.com, and will use SKoT's home address for correspondence.
