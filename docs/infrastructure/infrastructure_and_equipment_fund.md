## Purposes of the fund

- To maintain the existing equipment and infrastructure of the Artifactory.
- To upgrade the Artifactory’s infrastructure.

## Definitions

For purposes of this document:

- “Infrastructure” means items that are tangible, provide an enduring benefit to the members of the Artifactory, and are not equipment.
- “Equipment” means items that directly facilitate making things, are intended for use by the Artifactory’s members and casual users, and are not consumables.
- “Consumables” means items that would be expected to be used up within 12 months under the conditions of use prevailing at the Artifactory.

## Donating to the fund

To make your [tax-deductible donation](https://wiki.artifactory.org.au/en/docs/donating), you can:

1. Make a direct deposit to our donations account (preferred - we get 100% of the money this way!)

    Name: `Perth Artifactory Inc`
    BSB: `086 366`
    Account: `329 833 366`
    Description: `Infrastructure Fund`

2. [Contact us via email](mailto:treasurer@artifactory.org.au)

## Typical uses of the fund

1. Maintenance and upgrades to the Artifactory’s infrastructure.
2. Maintenance and repair of existing equipment.
3. Improving the space so it is more welcoming and visually attractive
4. Replacement of existing equipment that is no longer fit for service, on a like-for-like basis.
5. Consumable tooling.
6. Purchase of minor tools and equipment.

## Exclusions

1. Funding for new equipment worth more than $200 (in 2024 dollars).
  
   These should be funded through community pledges instead.
  
   This ensures there is community demand for new equipment before the Artifactory buys it.
  
## Authorisation to spend

Spending from this fund must be aligned with the purposes of the fund, and with the objects and purposes of the Artifactory.

Spending from this fund requires authorisation from either:

- The [Infrastructure subcommittee](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructurev2), within the terms of reference of that subcommittee, or;
- The management committee.

## Accounting

The money in this fund may be held in any of the Artifactory’s accounts. The money does not need to be held in a separate account.

The amount of money in the fund must be accounted for as donations are received to the fund, and money is spent from the fund.

If the money in the fund is held in an interest bearing account, the interest accrues to the Artifactory’s general funds.

## Emergency use of fund

If the Artifactory does not otherwise have enough money in its general funds to meet its liabilities as they fall due, the money in this fund may be used for that purpose.
