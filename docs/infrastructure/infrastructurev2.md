## Contact details

## Active Projects

Projects are tracked via [Taiga](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure)

## Terms of Reference

### Scope and responsibilities

The Infrastructure Subcommittee is responsible for coordinating the following:

* Project Leads for upgrades and repairs within the space
* Assistance for assigned Project Leads
* Internal funding proposals for space builds and repair costs
* Any other tasks assigned by the Management Committee provided that they are accepted by the subcommittee chair
* Appoint tool trainers as required, except for tools where that function is delegated to another subcommittee.
* Determine training requirements as required, except for tools where that function is delegated to another subcommittee.

### Coordination

The group will be loosely coordinated by the subcommittee chair. Individual projects will be coordinated by a designated Project Lead or another method determined by the subcommittee.

### Membership

The Infrastructure Subcommittee chair and the Management Committee have the ability to add or remove members of the subcommittee.

The Infrastructure Subcommittee chair is appointed by the Management Committee.

### Budgetary Requirements and Space Usage

The Infrastructure Subcommittee may request funds from the Management Committee. If approved the subcommittee may designate expense authority within the subcommittee subject to approval by the Treasurer.

The Management Committee authorises the subcommittee to waive tool usage fees when working on projects that are inline with the responsibilities of the subcommittee.

The subcommittee may requisition space within The Artifactory provided that any subcommittee materials do not interfere with scheduled events or the activities of Artifactory Members. This requisition must be upheld at the next meeting of the Management Committee in order to continue. It is the responsibility of the subcommittee chair to notify the Secretary that a requisition has taken place.

### Tools and Procedures for Communication

The subcommittee will determine their own communication procedures.

### Decisions made by the subcommittee

A determination made by the subcommittee is to be made by a simple majority of subcommittee members.

This section may be modified by the subcommittee using the existing process for subcommittee determinations.

### Expected Duration

Indefinite.
