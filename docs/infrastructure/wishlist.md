## Wood

* Geared drill press with electronic speed control
  * Something like the [Hare and Forbes](https://www.machineryhouse.com.au/d176) one
  * Would need to be single phase (most aren't)
* Edge sander
  * Sideways belt sander, better for a lot of the sanding we do
  * Most can switch between 0° and 90° so it could also replace our belt sander (since we have a stand alone disc sander)
  * [Carbatec](https://www.carbatec.com.au/carbatec-wide-belt-sander-oscillating-150mm-2200w) have one that does 0/90, (but is 15A) [Timbercon](https://www.timbecon.com.au/products/sherwood-oscillating-belt-sander-6in-2200w-edge-sander-with-cabinet-stand)'s does 0-90 (better) (10A)
* Helical upgrade for Dewalt Thicknesser 

## Metal

* Better metal bandsaw
  * Single phase preferred but 3p not an issue
  * Auto coolant, main benefit over the current one
* Lathe DRO
  * Deals with backlash
  * Easier to see than dials

## Soft craft

* Embroidery machine

## Electronics

* Modern oscilloscope
  * Easier to see
  * Can log to laptop etc
  
## Design

* [Spacemouse](https://3dconnexion.com/au/spacemouse/)
  * Mouse set up for 3D modelling
  
## Kitchen

* Wood pizza oven
* Bain marie
  * Not one of the free standing cabinet things, just benchtop
* Better outdoor dining table

## Misc

* Forklift
  * Walk behind better (inhouse training)
* Screw compressor
  * 3p is fine/expected
* More air filters
  * Can never have too many hung across the space
  * [This style](https://www.timbecon.com.au/collections/room-air-filters/products/sherwood-1000cfm-room-cleaner-air-purifier-workshop-air-filtration)
  * Doesn't matter if the controller is cooked etc, chances are we'll bypass it anyway
* Tool/service trolleys
