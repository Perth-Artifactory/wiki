# Ryobi EMS254L Drop Saw / Mitre Saw

The Ryobi EMS254L 254mm (10″) Compact Slide Mitre Saw/Compound saw/Drop saw is suitable for cutting through just about anything, provided you are using the correct blade. It is currently set up on a movable trolley and can be used out the back if you are cutting a lot of material or a material that is particularly noxious.  
  

## Approved Users

## Instructions for Use

### Changing the Blade

**Important Note**: :!: :!: If you are trying to use anything other than a spanner to replace the blade, you have gone too far, stop and ask for help.

#### Step 1

<img src="/tools/toolphotos/ems254l/bladechange/dropsaw-bladechange1.jpg" class="align-left" width="300" alt="dropsaw-bladechange1.jpg" /> Using a spanner, remove the bolt holding the blade guard cover in place.

#### Step 2

<img src="/tools/toolphotos/ems254l/bladechange/dropsaw-bladechange2.jpg" class="align-left" width="300" alt="dropsaw-bladechange2.jpg" /> Move the blade guard aside to expose the blade mount. Remove the blade retaining bolt, washer and finally the blade itself.  
*Note that the blade retention bolt is left-hand-threaded; i.e. **opposite** to normal (so it's lefty-tighty righty-loosey!). A memory aid: If a foolish person was to hold the bolt while it is spinning, it would tighten it up - one needs to turn the bolt head the "other" way to loosen. *

#### Step 4

<img src="/tools/toolphotos/ems254l/bladechange/dropsaw-bladechange3.jpg" class="align-left" width="300" alt="dropsaw-bladechange3.jpg" /> Insert the new blade ensuring that the arrow on the top blade cover (Silver metal bit above the blade) matches the arrow on the blade.

#### Step 5

<img src="/tools/toolphotos/ems254l/bladechange/dropsaw-bladechange5.jpg" class="align-left" width="300" alt="dropsaw-bladechange5.jpg" /> Put the blade retention washer back on.

#### Step 6

<img src="/tools/toolphotos/ems254l/bladechange/dropsaw-bladechange6.jpg" class="align-left" width="300" alt="dropsaw-bladechange6.jpg" /> Put the blade retention bolt back in and reassemble the blade guard cover.  
*Remember the blade retention bolt is threaded **opposite** to normal (lefty-tighty righty-loosey)*
