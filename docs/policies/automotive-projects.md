# Automotive Projects

These policies apply to automotive projects, including work on cars, vans, motorbikes, etc.

## Workspace usage

The Perth Artifactory is first and foremost a makerspace, not an automotive workshop.

However work on vehicles in the space is permitted on the following conditions:

- Works must not be undertaken during a [calendered event](https://artifactory.org.au/events).
- Only works that are in the scope of a service, such as an oil and fluid change, may be performed by non keyholders.
- Any works beyond this within the workshop require prior approval from a committee member and are largely restricted to only key holding members. Such works include disassembly and removal of components that may potentially render the vehicle unsafe or undriveable.
- Vehicles must not block entry into the main workshop area via the foyer.
- Spray painting can only be performed in the rear courtyard.
- Any works on vehicles in the car park area must not emit dust, fumes, or debris onto other vehicles or surfaces.
- The attendee has posted about the project on the [#car-and-bike Slack channel](https://perthartifactory.slack.com/archives/CSJDD2RRN) to ensure the space has not been double booked.


## Safety

- Do not leave vehicles running inside the workshop.
- Vehicles should not be left on jacks longer than is necessary to transfer them to stands.
- Vehicles on stands must be supervised (in sight) by the owner.


## How this policy interacts with other bylaws

These sections are intended to clarify how working on cars interacts with other bylaws.

## Storage

> These policies follow from the existing [storage by laws](/docs/policies/storage). Their application to vehicle projects is clarified here.

- Vehicles must not be left in the workshop overnight. (See [workspace usage](/docs/policies/storage#workspace-usage).)

- Don't park your vehicle in the car park overnight. (See [car park](/docs/policies/storage#car-park).)

- Don't do anything to your vehicle that may leave it undrivable at the end of the day.

  - Contact the committee if an exceptional situation occurs.
