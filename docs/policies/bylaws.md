## Minors in the space

Last modified at the [2025-03-22](/minutes/Committee/2025-03-22#by-law-membership-class-cleanup) meeting of the Management Committee.

Our space is a collaborative workshop, not a child care service. Minors (people under the age of 18) are welcome to attend and participate in the space, provided they are supervised by a responsible guardian.

The guardian must ensure that the minor โ

- Complies with our policies and procedures (e.g. the Training policy and Code of Conduct).
- Follows all appropriate safety requirements (e.g. wears appropriate PPE).
- Is not endangered by activities occurring in the space.
- Does not interfere with members and attendees.
- Does not consume alcohol.

Different levels of supervision are required based on the area and the activities occurring in the area.

- For *General supervision*, the guardian must be โ
  - present in the space, and
  - able to see the minor, and
  - generally aware of what the minor is doing.

- For *Active supervision*, the guardian must be โ
  - in the same area as the minor, and
  - actively aware of what the minor is doing, and
  - ready to physically intervene if required.
        
- Any attendee can temporarily declare that an area is an *active supervision area*, based on the presence of โ
  - Hazardous conditions or activities, e.g. power tools, spray painting, hot works.
  - Something easy to damage, e.g. wet paint, delicate parts.

## Policies and Guidelines

### Social Media Guidelines

Adopted at committee meeting: 2019-06-22.

The Perth Artifactory uses social media to:

- Raise awareness of the Artifactory brand, offerings and events,
- Inspire creativity, stimulate curiosity, empower others to make stuff,
- Promote an inclusive makerspace environment and encourage people to join the community.

Our online presence can be used to help spread awareness and extend our reach. Posts to social media should support the objectives of the organisation with consideration to how these messages will be received by the community and its impact on the Artifactory sustainable social licence to operate.

The Perth Artifactory and social media accounts are run by volunteers who give their time to support the space. Social media guidelines are not intended to make posting more difficult, but as a layer of protection to identify any risks and resolve them before posting, and to know when to seek approval from the Committee. The list below, while not comprehensive, is intended as a checklist to consider the potential impacts before posting to social media. If a post raises any concerns from the list, the poster should contact a committee member, to review the content and get approval before posting.

- **Safety**: Could anyone hurt themselves doing this? Is there a disclaimer to warn of risks? (i.e. Do not try this at home). Is everyone following correct safety procedures? (e.g. using appropriate PPE, observing fire hazards etc.).
- **Intellectual Property**: Who has rights over this? Who owns or contributed? Is it a fair representation of work, credit given to creator(s). Has an applicable copyright been invoked? Is any artwork being modified or destroyed? Has the creator consented to modifications?
- **Individuals and Groups**: Does the post refer to anyone (by name or implied), or a group, demographic or identity? Has the individual or group given consent, or would they feel comfortable being associated with the Artifactory?
- **Photography and Video**: Permission of subjects to release, including parent or legal guardian for minors.
- **General**: Would you be happy if this post went viral (received a lot of attention)? Does this represent the objectives of the Artifactory? If you were contacted to investigate the post, would you be happy to answer questions about it?
