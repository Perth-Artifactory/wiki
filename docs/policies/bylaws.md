## Policies and Guidelines

### Social Media Guidelines

Adopted at committee meeting: 2019-06-22.

The Perth Artifactory uses social media to:

- Raise awareness of the Artifactory brand, offerings and events,
- Inspire creativity, stimulate curiosity, empower others to make stuff,
- Promote an inclusive makerspace environment and encourage people to join the community.

Our online presence can be used to help spread awareness and extend our reach. Posts to social media should support the objectives of the organisation with consideration to how these messages will be received by the community and its impact on the Artifactory sustainable social licence to operate.

The Perth Artifactory and social media accounts are run by volunteers who give their time to support the space. Social media guidelines are not intended to make posting more difficult, but as a layer of protection to identify any risks and resolve them before posting, and to know when to seek approval from the Committee. The list below, while not comprehensive, is intended as a checklist to consider the potential impacts before posting to social media. If a post raises any concerns from the list, the poster should contact a committee member, to review the content and get approval before posting.

- **Safety**: Could anyone hurt themselves doing this? Is there a disclaimer to warn of risks? (i.e. Do not try this at home). Is everyone following correct safety procedures? (e.g. using appropriate PPE, observing fire hazards etc.).
- **Intellectual Property**: Who has rights over this? Who owns or contributed? Is it a fair representation of work, credit given to creator(s). Has an applicable copyright been invoked? Is any artwork being modified or destroyed? Has the creator consented to modifications?
- **Individuals and Groups**: Does the post refer to anyone (by name or implied), or a group, demographic or identity? Has the individual or group given consent, or would they feel comfortable being associated with the Artifactory?
- **Photography and Video**: Permission of subjects to release, including parent or legal guardian for minors.
- **General**: Would you be happy if this post went viral (received a lot of attention)? Does this represent the objectives of the Artifactory? If you were contacted to investigate the post, would you be happy to answer questions about it?

### Artifactory Funded Project

Adopted at committee meeting: 2019-11-02.

This policy applies to any project undertaken by Artifactory members for the purpose of improving the space that requires Artifactory committee approval for funding or space usage. It does not apply to projects undertaken by a Subcommittee.

Funding proposals should include the following:

PEOPLE

- **Project Lead**: Member who is undertaking or coordinating the project works.
- **Committee Correspondent**: Committee Member tasked with ensuring the committee is updated at regular meetings (This may be the same Member as Project Lead).
- **Specialist Correspondent**: The Committee may appoint another member who is known to have skills within the area of the project to verify viability if the committee cannot determine this within their own skill set

OVERVIEW

- **Benefit to the Artifactory**: This is the project sales pitch. Present to the committee why they should invest in your idea.
