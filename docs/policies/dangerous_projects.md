> This policy only covers projects you work on in our workshop. Tool use is covered under our [Training policy](/docs/policies/training)
{.is-info}

Before you work on a project at the Artifactory, you must assess if your project could:

* Kill, injure, or otherwise impact on the **health and safety of any person**.
* Damage **property**, **premises**, or the **environment**.
* Damage the Artifactory's **reputation in the community** - i.e. our social license to operate.

You must demonstrate to the committee that:

* You have the appropriate skills, knowledge, and qualifications to both a) safely, and b) legally, work on the project.
* You have identified hazards, and implemented controls, to achieve an acceptable level of risk.

The committee may require you to submit a formal risk assessment, in writing, before approving your project.

**Dangerous projects must be approved by at least two members of the committee or delegated approvers**

## What projects do we consider dangerous?

Danger comes in many forms, a **non-exhaustive** list has been included below to help you gauge and understand what we consider dangerous. If you are unsure whether your project is considered dangerous please reach out via #general on Slack or via [email](mailto:committee@artifactory.org.au).

### Electrical

* Voltages over 50V AC or 120V ripple-free DC[^1]
* Current exceeding 10A
* Intentional electrical arcing
* Stored electrical energy (capacitors, inductors) with the potential to discharge into people
* Self assembled battery packs (e.g. spot welding lithium-ion batteries)

*Note:Commercial devices are excluded from this category provided that you aren't modifying the device or wiring it yourself.*

[^1]: Voltages where the work is classed as Electrical Work under [§4A.iii](https://www.legislation.wa.gov.au/legislation/prod/filestore.nsf/FileURL/mrdoc_47829.htm/$FILE/Electricity%20(Licensing)%20Regulations%201991%20-%20%5B07-ac0-01%5D.html?OpenElement#:~:text=nominal%20pressure%20exceeding-,50%C2%A0volts%20alternating%20current%20or%20120%C2%A0volts%20ripple%20free%20direct%20current,-%3B%20and) of the WA Electricity (Licensing) Regulations 1991

### Pressurised gases/liquids

* Any system over 20 PSI where fittings are not commercially crimped or vessels are not certified for the expected pressure.
* Any system over 145 PSI

### Temperature

* Expected temperatures of solids are less than -20°C or greater than 200°C
* Expected temperatures of liquids are less than -50°C or greater than 100°C

*Note: These limits do not apply to 3D printers*

### Fire

* Flammable gases
* Open flames

### Radiation

* Lasers greater than Class 3R[^2]
* Artificial UV light less than 300nm
* Microwave radiation outside of a properly functioning microwave appliance
* Radioactive material
* Ionising radiation

### Chemical/Material

* Substances with the ability to cause harm when exposed to skin or eyes including:
  * Concentrated acids, bases, and oxidizing agents. For example: sodium hydroxide, concentrated hydrochloric and sulfuric acid, potassium permanganate, chlorine gas.
  * Heavy metals such as mercury
* Materials that react in a highly exothermic manner when exposed to water (e.g. alkali metals like elemental sodium/potassium)
* Bromine and other volatile toxic liquids
* Large quantities of gases (Where the quantity is high enough to adversely affect breathing)

### Mechanical/Gravity

* Suspended loads with the potential to fall on people or cause crush injuries
* Springs with the potential to cause injury
* Exposed fast moving parts
* Projectiles

### Noise

* Hazardous noise [^3]

[^3]: [WorkSafe | Hazardous noise](https://www.worksafe.wa.gov.au/noise)

### Weapons

* Controlled weapons or edged weapons as defined in relevant legislation[^4]

## Prohibited projects

The following types of projects are absolutely prohibited:

* Prohibited weapons and firearms as defined in relevant legislation[^4][^6]
* Accessories for prohibited weapons and firearms
* Drugs and drug paraphernalia
* Material containing asbestos
* Fractal burning / Lichtenburg burning[^5]
