## Tool Usage Fees

*Endorsed at committee meeting 2022-11-26, taking effect immediately.*

*xxx Last modified at committee meeting 2019-11-02. xxx*

This page is the **authoritative reference** regarding usage fees for the tools and equipment listed below.

Tool usage fees generally reflect the cost of consumables, operation, maintenance, and upgrades to the tools and equipment.

* Members pay the "member rate", excepting where the member's class of membership states that they pay the "casual rate".
  * Ed: Really need to fix the definitions of "classes of membership" to explicitly say, for each and every class of membership, whether the "member rate" or the "casual rate" is charged for tool usage.
  * Ed: Consider changing the language so that the rates are called "Standard rate" and "Discount rate".

* All other users pay the "casual rate".

* Casual users of the Artifactory pay the "Casual Makers" rate above, in addition to applicable tool usage fees.
  * Ed: Again, consider renaming the rates to "Standard" and "Discount" to avoid confusion between casual users, and financial members (such as band memberships) who nonetheless pay the casual user rate.
