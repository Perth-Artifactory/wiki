The National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS) plays a crucial role in assisting people with disabilities achieve equitable access to our community and facilities. For any queries regarding items on this page please [contact us](mailto:info@artifactory.org.au).

Here's a breakdown of how we interact with the various components of the NDIS, including Participants and Providers.

## Participants

The Artifactory strives to create an inclusive and accessible environment for all members of our community. We understand that participants in the NDIS may have diverse needs, and we are committed to meeting these in the most effective and respectful ways possible. Depending on circumstances we may be able to provide:

* A safe, supportive, and creative environment
* Tailored inductions and access plans
* Accessibility adaptations for machines where possible
* Letters of support for applicable equipment grant applications (external to the NDIS)
* Project guidance to make financially responsible decisions regarding projects

We are open to feedback to further improve our facilities and services to better support NDIS participants.

## Providers

The Artifactory works in close collaboration with a range of NDIS providers. Our aim is to ensure the necessary support is made available for NDIS participants who choose to engage with our services. We focus on:

* Collaborating on tailored support plans for individuals
* Adapting to specific requirements wherever possible
* Providing free induction/training (to the level available to our members) for support workers assisting clients in the workshop

We **strongly recommend** reaching out before including us in a participant's plan. This way we can determine whether our facilities are appropriate for the intended goal.

## Caveats

The Artifactory is a charity run entirely by volunteers and does not currently receive ongoing financial support from any government entity. We will do our best to make the workshop as accessible as possible and provide occasional guidance to support workers in our space.

* Artifactory members do not have the capacity to act as ongoing support workers themselves unless privately engaged.
* We cannot bill NDIA managed participants though we may still be able to assist relevant providers.
* While we can direct you to providers that have familiarity with our organisation we do not endorse specific businesses or workers.
* Any efforts outlined here are provided ad hoc by volunteers and we make no guarantees about current capacity or long term support.

## Revision history

This policy was endorsed by the committee on [2023-11-25](/minutes/Committee/2023-11-25#ndis-policy).
