### Member Storage - Additional

Updated at committee meeting 2019-05-25.

Effective from 2019-07-01.

Members are entitled to request for additional storage on the pallet racking. Additional storage will be charged at a rate of \$60 per half a pallet rack per month and will be restricted to the upper racks that are not within reach. Any four Committee members may determine what part of the pallet racking will be available for such storage and will advise the Treasurer to invoice as such from the start of the Members next membership period. The Artifactory Committee reserves the right to revoke that additional storage with a months notice if it is deemed needed for the Artifactory.

### Workspace Usage

Adopted at committee meeting 2019-11-02.

* You may occupy up to 3 trestles worth of space while actively working on a project noting that you may need to move it for a scheduled event.
* Projects may be left in the space for three days so long as:
* The project is on a single trestle table(including under) that includes your name, contact details, and date of pickup
* Your project is left in a movable state as events/workshops may have priority over a specified area/general area resulting in the moving of your project.
* While we will attempt to contact you if any of these conditions are not met there is risk that your project may be disposed of or end up on the hack-me bench. The Artifactory does not guarantee the safety of any personal projects.
* Anything that would violate the requirements set out above must be done in coordination with the Management Committee.
* Committee can veto these rules.
