# Guidance for subcommittees

This page gives guidance for how subcommittees should be run.

Refer to the [subcommittees by-law](/docs/policies/subcommittees) for mandatory requirements.

## Responsibilities

Within their area of responsibility, and if it is within their terms of reference, the sub-committee will be the appropriate place for normal members to:

* Obtain permission/training to access/operate,
* Request maintenance or obtain permission to maintain,
* Request a modification or obtain permission to modify, and
* Request updates on the current operational status.

## Actions

Any action taken by the subcommittee should be communicated to all members of the subcommittee.

Sub-committees should generally operate on a "plan" then "do" model which enables all members of the subcommittee to be aware of the plans before they are put into effect.

Membership of a sub-committee does not give individuals the freedom to act unilaterally. A sub-committee has been formed by the main committee to allow a team to work on a task.

## Documentation

The subcommittee should maintain public documentation for all things within their terms of reference.

Sub-committees should nominate a secretary to be responsible for minuting and reporting.

## Reporting

The subcommittee should be ready and willing to report the current status of any action they are undertaking to:

* Their own members.
* A main committee member.
* The main committee at each committee meeting.
