This is the [by-law](/docs/policies/bylaws) governing subcommittees.

By-laws are made by the committee, as allowed for rule 65 of the [Constitution](/constitution) regarding *By-laws*.

## Background (informative)

Subcommittees allow normal members (and even non-members) to participate in running the Artifactory.

A well run subcommittee ---

* Takes load off the management committee; and
* Allows the Artifactory to benefit from specialist experience; and
* Is open to scrutiny and observation by interested members; and
* Is run in a friendly and collegial way.

## Objects of this by-law

This by-law extends the rules of the constitution regarding subcommittees, to provide a practical framework for starting, running, and disbanding subcommittees.

## Terms used

Unless the contrary intention appears, all terms are as defined as in the Constitution, and the following:

* "the Act" means the Associations Incorporation Act 2015 (WA).
* "Artifactory" means the Association.
* "Committee" means the management committee of the Association.
* "Committee member" means a member of the management committee.
* "Constitution" means the rules of the Association.

## Appointment of subcommittee

The committee may appoint a subcommittee as per rule 49 of the constitution.

The committee must define in writing ---

* The name of the subcommittee.
* The terms of reference of the subcommittee.
* The powers or duties delegated to the subcommittee, subject to rule 50 of the constitution.
* The people who will be the initial members of the subcommittee.

## Membership of subcommittee

A subcommittee ---

* must have at least two members.
* must include at least one committee member.
* may include any person the committee considers appropriate, whether the person is a member or not.

A person may be appointed to, or removed from, a subcommittee ---

* By the committee; or
* By the subcommittee, subject to approval by the committee.

## Operation

A member of a subcommittee may require any action of a subcommittee to be approved by a motion of the subcommittee.

A motion of a subcommittee is carried if a majority of the members of the subcommittee vote in favour of the motion.

A subcommittee may otherwise meet and conduct business in any way its members see fit, subject to ---

* The constitution and by-laws of the Association; and
* The terms of reference of the subcommittee; and
* The written delegation of powers or duties to the subcommittee.

## Record keeping

The subcommittee must maintain a page on the wiki which records ---

* The name of the subcommittee.
* The terms of reference of the subcommittee, and the powers and duties currently delegated to the subcommittee.
* The name of each member of the subcommittee.
* The contact details for the subcommittee.

The subcommittee must ensure that minutes are taken and kept of each meeting of the subcommittee.

The subcommittee must make a record of ---

* Any change to the name, terms of reference, powers and duties delegated, or membership of the subcommittee.
* Any motion on which a vote is taken, and the result of the vote.

The subcommittee must provide the Association with the name and address of each person who is a member of the subcommittee, so that the Association can keep a record of office holders as required by Section 58(2) of the Act.

> Section 58(2) of the Act requires the Association to maintain a record of the names **and addresses** of the persons who "hold other offices of the association provided for by its rules", such as members of subcommittees.
> 
> The definition of **address** in the Act includes any of a residential, business, PO box, or email address.
> 
> Addresses should be stored in the Association's member management system (e.g. TidyHQ).

## Annual review

Before the annual general meeting, the secretary must contact each current subcommittee member, and ask whether they intend to continue as a subcommittee member or not.

At the first committee meeting after each annual general meeting, the committee must consider each subcommittee, and determine -

* Whether the subcommittee meets the minimum requirements to continue operating; and
* If the subcommittee will continue or be disbanded; and
* Whether each subcommittee member's appointment will continue or cease.

## Disbanding

A subcommittee is disbanded when any of the following takes place ---

* There are less than two subcommittee members.
* The subcommittee does not include a committee member.
* The subcommittee reports to the committee that they have resolved to disband.
* The committee decides to disband the subcommittee ---
  * After the annual review; or
  * Because the subcommittee has exceeded its delegated authority; or
  * For any other reason.

All powers and duties delegated to a subcommittee are revoked when the subcommittee is disbanded.
