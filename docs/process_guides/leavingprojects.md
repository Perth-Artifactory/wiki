## Leaving a Project

-   The Artifactory does not guarantee the safety of any personal projects.
-   Projects may be left in the space for a few days so long as:
    -   The project is on a single trestle table
    -   The trestle table can be moved by two members without disturbing your project
    -   A sign is left on the table that includes your name, contact details, and date of pickup
    -   Your project will not be left in the space during events that require either the entire project area/general area or all of the trestle tables. It is your responsibility to check the calendar and confirm.
-   While we will attempt to contact you if any of these conditions are not met there is risk that your project may be disposed of or end up on the hack-me bench.
-   Anything that would violate the requirements set out above must be done in coordination with the Management Committee.
