# Who are we? 

The Artifactory is a not-for-profit shared workspace and community that's run entirely by volunteers

# What this will cover

* Constitution and By-laws
* Code of Conduct
* Finance and admin info
* Storing things in the space
* Accessing the workshop

##

* Training
* Communal items
* Communication
* Tech resources

# Our Constitution and bylaws

Our Constitution governs how the organisation operates, everything flows down from this document. The full document can be found by searching `Constitution` on the wiki.

## Who makes decisions about the space?

Each year a Management Committee is elected from our members. The Committee sets the overall direction of the organisation for the year and makes the practical day to day decisions that keep the space running. (Constitution Part 5)

## Your rights as a member

When disputes arise in the space you're able to make use of our dispute resolution process. (Constitution Part 4)

## By-laws

The Management Committee sets out the day to day operation of the space through the use of by-laws. The full text can be found by searching `By-laws` on the wiki.

# Code of Conduct {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

Our code of conduct is the guiding document for your actions in the space. You can find it:

* On the wiki by searching for `Code of Conduct`
* On our main website: artifactory.org.au
* In the workshop just through the foyer door

The following blue slides will go through a condensed version of the code as it applies to you.

# Respectful Behaviour {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

Treat one another with respect

## Diversity and discrimination expectations {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

The Artifactory attendees come from a diverse variety of backgrounds. That diversity enriches our community and so we must work to ensure all members feel welcome and safe. Sexual harassment, bullying or discrimination will not be tolerated - both in person and online. Any behaviours that make attendees feel uncomfortable or unsafe are unacceptable and action will be taken to ensure a safe environment for all attendees.

## Disagreements {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

Sometimes disagreements can be frustrating but that is no excuse for poor behaviour or poor manners. Disagreement, debate and constructive criticism can help develop ideas but it should never cross into personal attacks.

## Volunteers {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

Many Artifactory attendees offer training, help and advice to members and visitors. We should be mindful that these people are volunteers and so must be treated with respect and allowed time to work on their own projects if they so wish. The best way to say thank you to our volunteers is by:

## {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

* Checking the whiteboard near the front of the space for things that haven't been done in a while
* Helping with the communal cleaning - empty the bins, vacuum the project area
* Tidying up the space - sort the hardware drawers, neaten the tool racks
* Volunteering to help with a project or event

## Cleaning up after yourself {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

Our workshop is a shared space with an abundance of communal work areas and tools. Leave the space clean and tidy for other attendees so that volunteers donâ€™t have to spend time cleaning up after you.

* Leave the space cleaner than you found it.
* Pick up your rubbish.
* Put away everything you used.
* Put food waste in the carpark skip bin.
* Clean the area you worked in - wipe, sweep, vacuum.

# Safe Use of Tools {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

The safety of every member is very important

## Work safely {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

* Most of our equipment and power tools require an induction before they can be used. This is covered in more detail later on.
* Only use tools you are authorised to use.
* Follow the safety/operational requirements we set out in tool inductions.
* Ask for help with tools you're not confident using, even after you've been signed off.
* Ensure access areas are kept clean and tools are stored safely.
* Ensure that your clothing is appropriate.

## Working under the influence {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

Do not use tools while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or other inhibiting substances.

# Integrity {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

Always be honest

## Report damage {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

Report any damage to tools including mistakes you make. It happens, we have all been there! If you come across damaged tools or low consumables, likewise report it.

## Respect ownership {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

Respect the ownership of tools and materials. Do not remove Artifactory equipment from the premises. Ensure you have permission before using tools or material owned by our members.

# Complaints and Reporting {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

## Who to contact {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

* Talk to a committee member (see: committee members list)
* Email the management committee: committee@artifactory.org.au
* Email the executive committee (Chair, Deputy Chair, Secretary, Treasurer): exec@artifactory.org.au
* Slack direct message to a committee member
* Ask another Artifactory member to report the incident on your behalf

We have processes in place to ensure confidentiality of reported incidents.

## What will happen {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

All incidents are handled on a case-by-case basis. Depending on the incident, the response may include:

* Talking with the involved people, explaining the issues and building better understanding between attendees
* Written formal warning for the specific incident
* Suspension/termination of membership including restricted access to the premises and online platforms
* Reporting to relevant authorities/regulators

# Finance and Admin

## Membership dues

Your membership dues are not paid automatically. Our preferred method of payment is via a scheduled bank transfer, on the monthly date of joining. (Bank details are on your membership invoices)

## Paying for tool usage

Some of our tools have usage fees attached. (Covered during the induction for the tools in question)

Please use the bank account rather than the EFTPOS when paying for tool usage. This helps us keep track of how much each tool is used.

## Keep your contact details up to date

It's your responsibility to update this information in TidyHQ when it changes.

* Your full name
* Your contact information (email and physical address)
* Your emergency contact information

TidyHQ is the system where you signed up as a member.

## Resignation

We operate on a month-to-month basis which means there's no penalty for deciding you'd like to cancel or pause your membership. If you want to do either of these please **let us know** rather than just disappearing. Remember it's always a volunteer following up on overdue invoices.

# Reporting

## Where to report

Most things are reported/requested via a form system built into Slack. Further slides will just list the form name.

![](https://wiki.artifactory.org.au/taiga_form.png)

## Injuries

Reporting injuries and near misses helps us change our facilities and processes to prevent future incidents.

Form: Injury/Near Miss Report

## Workshop cleanliness and tool repair

The workshop only works if people are held accountable for leaving the workshop a mess.

Form: Workshop Cleanliness and Tool Damage

# Storage

The what, where, when, and how of leaving things in the space

## Individual member storage space

Members can request a personal storage locker (subject to availability)

Form: Request a locker

## Sheet material racks

You can store sheets of material opposite the laser scrap and outside the machine room in the racks. Check the signs on each rack for:

* How your material must be labelled
* How long it can be stored
* How much you can store

## Workspace Usage

* When actively working on a project you can occupy up to three trestles provided the trestles (or the space) aren't needed for an event

## Short term storage

If you need to leave a project in the workspace (paint drying etc)

* You leave your property unattended at your own risk.
* You may leave your property in the work space for up to three days.
* You must prominently label your property with your name, contact details, and intended pickup date.

##

* Your property may occupy up to one trestle table's worth of work space.
* Your property must be left in a safe and movable state, in case your property needs to be moved for a scheduled event.

# Access

As a new member, your access to the space will initially be limited to the events on our calendar.

You may also be able to arrange with a key-holding member to attend the space with you, but there's no guarantee that a member will be available at any particular time and these arrangements should not be relied upon.

## 24/7 Access

Members who meet our requirements may apply for a 24/7 electronic key. The key requirements are fairly strict but aren't burdensome:

Form: Apply for a key

* Hold your membership for at least two weeks, (Bare minimum for application to be considered)
* Don't act against the interests of the Association, (Follow the Code of Conduct)
* Pay a bond ($135 concession, $225 full)
* Have no outstanding invoices and pay via bank transfer

##

* Demonstrate that you are competent to make decisions on who can enter the space
* Demonstrate that you can:
  * Work unsupervised,
  * Undertake tasks safely,
  * Clean your work area, and
  * Communicate any issues to committee.

# Training

Tools and equipment are split into three categories:

## Low risk {data-background-color="rgb(0, 82, 22)"}

You can self assess your competency on these tools and use them if you feel comfortable. Feel free to have a go and if you're not sure you can always ask for help. Even though these tools are low risk you should still be vigilant about safety.

* Hand tools (screwdrivers etc)
* Some power tools (Drills, vibrating sanders etc)

## Medium risk {data-background-color="rgb(179, 173, 4)"}

These tools can easily hurt you, others, or the tool. To use these tools you must either complete a short induction with one of our authorised trainers or demonstrate to them that you can use this tool safely.

* Most power tools (Circular saws, routers etc)
* Some equipment (Sand blaster, belt sander etc)

## High risk {data-background-color="rgb(120, 8, 2)"}

These tools can cause serious injury, are easy to damage, or both. An induction is required before using these tools. You must go through the Artifactoryâ€™s training on high risk tools, even if you have used similar (or identical) tools elsewhere.

* 3D Printers
* Large equipment (Mill, CNC router, laser cutters etc)

## How to tell which category tools are in

Most of our tools will include a coloured dot indicating their category. A full list of our tools can also be found here:

## Training refreshers and training expiry

(Added 2024-08-10)

You may need refresher training if -

* You haven't used a specific tool for 12 months, or
* The tool changes significantly, or
* The safe work procedure for the tool has changed.

We'll let you know if you need refresher training.

# Communal Materials

## Crafting materials

* Laser scrap rack - Flat pieces of material of useful size
* Hack rack - Fans, power supplies, scrap wood etc
* Upcycle rack - Old pieces of equipment that can be taken apart for components

##

* Cleaning products are in the kitchen
* Spray paint is stored in the filing cabinet in the back shed - unless labelled with someone's name.

## Check!

For other areas of the space check with another member before you start using supplies. Many supplies belong to individual members.

## 

If you find you are using a lot of a communal supply (super glue, turpentine, masking tape, wood screws...), or you have used up the last of something, you should buy more for the space. The supplies you used were also donated by other members.

# Communication

## Slack

Slack is the number one point of contact for anything and everything Artifactory.

If you would like to be trained on a certain machine, report a fault with the equipment, or even need input and advice for your current project there will usually be a specific channel for your question. If you're not sure ask in #general.
