This is a self paced introduction to our community and workshop. If you have questions, jot them down and ask one of our volunteers afterwards.

You can navigate these slides using the <kbd>spacebar</kbd>.

# Who are we? 

The Artifactory is a not-for-profit shared workspace and community that's run entirely by volunteers.

# Code of Conduct {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

Our code of conduct is the guiding document for your actions in the space. You can find it:

* On the wiki by searching for `Code of Conduct`
* On our main website: artifactory.org.au
* In the workshop just through the foyer door

The following slides will go through a condensed version of the code as it applies to you.

# Respectful Behaviour {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

Treat one another with respect

## Diversity and discrimination expectations {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

Artifactory attendees come from a diverse variety of backgrounds. That diversity enriches our community and so we must work to ensure all members feel welcome and safe. Sexual harassment, bullying or discrimination will not be tolerated - both in person and online. Any behaviours that make attendees feel uncomfortable or unsafe are unacceptable and action will be taken to ensure a safe environment for all attendees.

## Disagreements {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

Sometimes disagreements can be frustrating but that is no excuse for poor behavior or poor manners. Disagreement, debate and constructive criticism can help develop ideas but it should never cross into personal attacks.

## Volunteers {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

Many Artifactory attendees offer training, help and advice to members and visitors. Please be mindful that these people are volunteers and so must be treated with respect and allowed time to work on their own projects if they so wish. The best way to say thank you to our volunteers is by:

## {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

* Checking the whiteboard near the front of the space for things that haven't been done in a while
* Helping with the communal cleaning - empty the bins, vacuum the project area
* Tidying up the space - sort the hardware drawers, neaten the tool racks

## Cleaning up after yourself {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

Our workshop is a shared space with an abundance of communal work areas and tools. Leave the space clean and tidy for other attendees so that volunteers don’t have to spend time cleaning up after you.

* Leave the space cleaner than you found it.
* Pick up your rubbish.
* Put away everything you used.
* Put Food waste in the carpark skip bin.
* Clean the area you worked in - wipe, sweep, vacuum.

# Safe Use of Tools {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

The safety of every member is very important

## Work safely {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

Always follow established procedures, adhere to safety signage and wear appropriate protective equipment. Ask for help and training if you are unsure how to use our tools and follow that advice. Consider the risk to others around you and put up barriers, exclusion zones or signage as needed.

* Most of our equipment and power tools require an induction before they can be used. This is covered in more detail later on.
* Ensure access areas are kept clean, tools are safe.
* Ensure that your clothing is appropriate.

## Working under the influence {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

Do not use tools while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or other inhibiting substances.

# Integrity {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

Always be honest

## Report damage {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

Report any damage to tools including mistakes you make. It happens, we have all been there! If you come across damaged tools or low consumables, likewise report it.

## Respect ownership {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

Respect the ownership of tools and materials. Do not remove Artifactory equipment from the premises unless you have permission. Ensure you have permission before using another member’s tools or materials.

# Complaints and Reporting {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

## Who to contact {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

* Talk to a committee member (see: committee members list)
* Email the management committee: committee@artifactory.org.au
* Email the executive committee (Chair, Deputy Chair, Secretary, Treasurer): exec@artifactory.org.au
* Slack direct message to a committee member
* Ask another Artifactory member to report the incident on your behalf

We have processes in place to ensure confidentiality of reported incidents.

## What will happen {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

All incidents are handled on a case-by-case basis. Depending on the incident, the response may include:

* Talking with the involved people, explaining the issues and building better understanding between attendees
* Written formal warning for the specific incident
* Temporary suspension of membership including restricted access to the premises and online platforms

## {data-background-color="rgb(0, 6, 43)"}

* Termination of membership
* Barring from the Artifactory premises and online platforms
* Reporting to any relevant authorities

# Finance and Admin

## Paying for your day pass

Day Passes can be paid for at the bar. In most cases it costs $20 to attend the space for the day though some events are cheaper. If you're not sure check with an event host!

Please write your name and "day pass" on the merchant receipt and put it in the red box next to the EFTPOS.

## Paying for tool usage

Some of our tools have usage fees attached. (Covered during the induction for the tools in question)

Please use the bank account rather than the EFTPOS when paying for tool usage. This helps us keep track of how much each tool is used.

## Keep your contact details up to date

It's your responsbility to update this information in TidyHQ when it changes.

* Your full name
* Your contact information (email and physical address)
* Your emergency contact information

TidyHQ is the system you used when you signed up as a visitor.

# Reporting

## Injuries

If you hurt (or nearly hurt) yourself in the workshop let our volunteers know so we can help. We will also get you to fill out an incident report.

Reporting injuries and near misses helps us change our facilities and processes to prevent future incidents.

# Storage

Day Pass users cannot store projects in the space. Please plan ahead if doing projects that involve paint drying etc. If you're going to take up more than one tables worth of space chat with one of our volunteers.

# Access

As a day pass user you can access the workshop during events. Check the calendar for upcoming events.

# Training

Tools and equipment are split into three categories:

## Low risk {data-background-color="rgb(0, 82, 22)"}

You can self assess your competency on these tools and use them if you feel comfortable. Feel free to have a go and if you're not sure you can always ask for help. Even though these tools are low risk you should still be vigilant about safety.

* Hand tools (screwdrivers etc)
* Some power tools (Drills, vibrating sanders etc)

## Medium risk {data-background-color="rgb(179, 173, 4)"}

These tools can easily hurt you, others, or the tool. To use these tools you must either complete a short induction with one of our authorised trainers or demonstrate to them that you can use this tool safely.

* Most power tools (Circular saws, routers etc)
* Some equipment (Sand blaster, belt sander etc)

## High risk {data-background-color="rgb(120, 8, 2)"}

These tools can cause serious injury, are easy to damage, or both. An induction is required before using these tools. You must go through the Artifactory’s training on high risk tools, even if you have used similar (or identical) tools elsewhere. Only specific people are authorised to train on specific high risk tools. Many of these tools are available only to **members**.

* 3D Printers
* Large equipment (Mill, CNC router, laser cutters etc)

## How to get training

Take a look in #training_and_inductions on Slack and put your hand up for an applicable induction slot.

## How to check your existing training

Search for Training Tracker on Slack

## Training refreshers and training expiry

(Added 2024-08-10)

You may need refresher training if -

* You haven't used a specific tool for 12 months, or
* The tool changes significantly, or
* The safe work procedure for the tool has changed.

We'll let you know if you need refresher training.

# Communal Materials

## Crafting materials

* Laser scrap rack - Flat pieces of material of useful size
* Upcycle rack - Old pieces of equipment that can be taken apart for components

## Check!

For other areas of the space check with a volunteer before you start using supplies. Many supplies belong to individual members.

## 

If you find you are using a lot of a communal supply (superglue, turpentine, masking tape, wood screws...), or you have used up the last of something, you should buy more for the space. The supplies you used were also donated by other members.

# Communication

## Slack

Slack is the number one point of contact for anything and everything Artifactory.

If you would like to be trained on a certain machine, report a fault with the equipment, or even need input and advice for your current project there will usually be a specific channel for your question. If you're not sure ask in #general.

artifactory.org.au/slack
