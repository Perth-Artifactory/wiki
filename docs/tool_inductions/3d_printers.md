Open Bambu Studio
Bambu - new project
new project will have blank settings.

dropdown list of machines.
go to room - familiarise with machines.

Show how to load X1 AMS.
Show how to configure filament type and colour on the X1.
Generic PLA only.

* All filaments generic
* PLA only at this level of induction.
* PETG separate induction.
* ABS, ASA, etc currently off limits.
* No BYO filament.
  * Risk of mislabelled filaments (e.g. PLA vs PVC)
  * Health and safety.
  * Unknown abrasive content.
  * Unknown quality.
  * If you want something non standard - just ask.

Explain filament storage shelves.

Explain that P1S is different to X1 screen.
Explain how to configure P1S filament types from Bambu Studio.

In the Bambu Studio.
Plates/sheets
Explain sheet types, smooth textured, etc.
Printer may notice - or it might not!!

Explain multiple filaments in Bambu Studio.
Sync from printer.

Explain presets.
Layer heights, strength, normal, draft.

Explain various adjustment settings.

* Layer height - 0.2 initial, adjust subsequent layer heights as wanted. No less than 0.10mm (risk of clogging). 0.12mm generally minimum recommended. Printing at less than 0.10mm will result in loss of printing privileges.
* Line width - don't adjust.
* Wall loops - affects strength - by experimentation and experience.
* Infill - affects strength - by experimentation and experience.
* Top and bottom shells - leave at default.

Support.

* Explain why support needed.
* Overhang angles, bridge distances.
* Part orientation.
  * Lay on face
* Demo use axolotl.
  * Auto support.
  * Manual painted support. Left to paint support enforcement, right to paint support blocker.

Colour painting.

* Painting, fill painting.
* Multicolour printers require a purge tower and a purge for each filament change.
* Dramatic increase in time for each material change and purge.

Scaling

Rotation

Auto arrange

Payment

* Show how to get amount of filament from slicer. Total including model, support, purging, tower.
* Go to wiki.
* Search for "Fees".
* Explain tiers.
  * Show tier sticker on a physical roll
* Explain payment method.
