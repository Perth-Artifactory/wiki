| Item  | Requirement | Notes  |
| - | - | - |
| Eye protection (impact/splash) | M | Operation dependant |
| Gloves (chemical)              | N | Nitrile gloves etc will melt if they come into contact with the plate |
| Enclosed shoes                 | Y |  |
| Mask/Respirator (vapours)      | M | Potentially consider if no soldering filter is available. Treat the same as soldering precautions |

Allowed materials:

* PCBs

Specifically banned materials:

* Plastic
* Food

Consumables:

Pre:

1. Set the plate on a flat surface with at least 5cm of space on all sides
1. Plug in using an IEC/kettle cable from the tub in the elctronics lab and turn the equipment on
1. The unit will begin heating to the default temperature (265C) and then show the current plate temperature (inaccurate at low temps)
1. The plate is now getting hot, it will burn you if you touch it
1. Enter the temperature settings by pressing `SET` then set the desired temperature with the arrow keys. (Max 300C)
1. Press the `SET` button again to lock in the desired temperature and return to the current temperature screen

Using:


1. Do not leave the plate unattended during operation
1. Do not use the plate for longer than 15 minutes

After:

1. Turn off equipment using switch
1. Disconnect power cable and return to tub
1. Allow the equipment to cool before continuing
1. Check whether you've left any residue on the plate
1. Clean residue with a damp (not wet) sponge. Escalate to dish soap or steel wool if required. Do not allow cleaning products to enter the cavity under the plate.
1. Ensure all residue and cleaning products have been completely removed from the plate (ie anything that may burn when it's used again)
1. Ensure equipment is completely cool before returning to the bench
