| Enclosed shoes                 | Y | Sharp swarf |
| Safety boots                   | M | Depending on weight of material |

Pre:

1. Confirm material is appropriate for blade type (Metal hardness up to steel)
1. Check blade sharpness and tension
1. Consider material orientation to reduce risk of movement
1. Clamp piece using machine clamp
1. Consider work holding after piece is cut

Using:

1. Consider using cutting fluid
1. Ensure tool is completely spun up before contacting material
1. Rest running blade on surface and adjust spring tension to achieve desired cut pressure
1. Tool *should* turn off automatically when material is cut through. May not actuate where end of cut takes a long time

After:

1. Piece may be hot
1. Cleanup includes tray under saw, ground
