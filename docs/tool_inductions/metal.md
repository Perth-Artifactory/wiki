## Bandsaw (Metal)

Lead: ???
Signed off by: XXX, Fletcher

| Item  | Requirement | Notes  |
| - | - | - |
| Eye protection (impact/splash) | Y | Flying swarf |
| Ear protection                 | M | No reason not to but isn't loud |
| Gloves (general)               | M | Sharp material |
| Enclosed shoes                 | Y | Sharp swarf |
| Safety boots                   | M | Depending on weight of material |

Pre:

1. Confirm material is appropriate for blade type (Metal hardness up to steel)
1. Check blade sharpness and tension
1. Consider material orientation to reduce risk of movement (flappy metal etc)
1. Clamp piece using machine clamp
1. Consider work holding after piece is cut
1. Machine technically supports being operated like a traditional bandsaw, not within scope of induction.

Using:

1. Consider using cutting fluid
1. Ensure tool is completely spun up before contacting material
1. Rest running blade on surface and adjust spring tension to achieve desired cut pressure
1. Cut speed is dependant on engaged material (top/bottom of box tube takes longer than sides)
1. Tool *should* turn off automatically when material is cut through. May not actuate where end of cut takes a long time

After:

1. Piece may be hot
1. Cleanup includes tray under saw, ground

Using:

1. Secure workpiece, use rests to support as needed
2. Stand to side of wheel when starting grinder

After:

1. Let wheels stop completely before leaving
2. Clean area of any grinding dust

| Item  | Requirement | Notes  |
| - | - | - |
| Face protection (impact/splash) | M | Situational depending on position/material |
| Eye protection (EMR)           | Y | Shade 6+ |
| Ear protection                 | Y | Compressed air noise |

| Natural fibre clothing         | Y | Sparks |

Consumables:

1. Torch consumables are in the office, ask a committee member for a set if required (kept secure because equipment can be used inappropriately in a way that burns through a lot of tips)

Pre:

1. Inspect tip and cap for damage/wear
1. Consider fire risk from sparks
1. Connect to compressed air and test flow with drain
1. Connect earth clamp - Use welding bench if clean or to part of material that will remain on the bench post cut (electrical safety considerations)
1. Adjust current for material thickness and comfortable feed speeds - Too low/fast and it won't cut through, too high/slow and material will warp. Internet has useful cut charts

Using:

1. Torch is set up for offset cutting and doesn't have a standoff guide, keep around 1.5mm from surface. Safer to be too high and have a poor cut than too close and make contact with the material. Splatter is good indication that torch is too far away if bevel size/shape can't be used as guide
1. Start torch at 90° if cutting from edge, 45° then pulled up to 90° if from center
1. Monitor spark direction, they should come straight out the other side of the piece. (Back at operator/opposite feed direction = too fast, Going straight down but gouging on surface/warping = too slow)
1. Running too slow will increase blowout on backside of material
1. Continue to reassess fire risk now that spark path is known

After:

1. Cut/dross will be sharp
1. Torch tip and material are both hot, cool down before putting away
1. Cleanup includes sweeping up spark debris if used inside

## Welder (Stick/SMAW)

Lead: Fletcher Boyd
Signed off by: Fletcher, XXX

| Item  | Requirement | Notes  |
| - | - | - |
| Eye protection (impact/splash) | Y | Sparks |
| Eye protection (EMR)           | Y | Shade 9-13 visible spectrum, full UV blocking - Only use welding helmets |
| Ear protection                 | M | Can be more comfortable for long jobs |
| Gloves (heat)                  | Y | Welding gloves |
| Enclosed shoes                 | Y |  |
| Safety boots                   | M | Sparks, material weight |
| Mask/Respirator (dust)         | M | Corresponding grinding dusk from associated tools |
| Mask/Respirator (vapours)      | M | A1 depending on material, oxide fumes are hazardous (zinc in galv etc) |
| Long sleeves                   | Y | Significant EMR/UV risk to all exposed skin |
| Natural fibre clothing         | Y | Splatter, sparks, arc heat |

Pre:

1. Ensure material and electrode are appropriate (including for intended direction, material, and polarity)
1. Confirm cables to handle/stinger and earth clamp are intact - any insulation damage = tag out
1. Confirm earth clamp copper is clean
1. Connect earth clamp to material or table (if using) - ensure all contact points are clean and clear of rust/oxide layer
1. Ensure material is clean and clear of rust
1. Consider operator position, prioritise comfort over short setup times
1. Fit electrode to handle
1. Set current using dial based on material thickness, check max current rating for electrode. Electrode sticking/can't maintain arc = too low, blowing out material/big puddle/charred electrode = too high
1. Test welding helmet using halogen lamp/sun or test button
1. Set helmet shade (if applicable) based on current. Start darker and decrease as required for puddle visibility. Do not go below shade 8 <100A and shade 10 <200A (taken from Aus standards, others recommend higher)
1. Consider anti splatter spray
1. Set up welding screens

Using:

1. Pick up handle (Don't create an unintended circuit)
1. Turn on machine
1. Confirm everyone with eyeline to machine has their helmet down and set appropriately
1. Strike arc (tap or match) - Anti stick feature on machine reduces fuse risk when tapping)
1. Pull electrode back to begin puddle
1. Bring electrode down to appropriate distance - usually same as labelled electrode thickness. Splatter/no puddle control = too far, operator can't keep electrode off of material = too close
1. Tilt electrode appropriately for operation - 10-15° drag for horizontal, ~15° push for vertical up - Goal is to keep crap out of weld
1. Run electrode in desired pattern ([useful image](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0024/3249/9821/files/Techniques_Stringer_drag_whip_Weave_Circles_crescent_zig_zag_600x600.jpg) while maintaining electrode distance. Consider if it's better to just come back for a second pass instead.
1. No need to act quickly if electrode stuck, protection circuit will have kicked in. Snap sideways to release and continue
1. Turn off machine before putting handle back on table

After:

1. Everything will be hot, don't put away hot things
1. Do not allow others to touch material with less protection than you have on, easy to forget how much heat is blocked by welding gloves
1. Cleanup includes splatter on bench as well as general sweeping of bench and area
1. Dispose of used electrode dregs
