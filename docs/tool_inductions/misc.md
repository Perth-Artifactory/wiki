| Gloves (general)               | M | Consider oil etc on vehicle |
| Enclosed shoes                 | Y |  |

Pre:

1. Verify jack capacity is greater than vehicle weight
1. Only on clear level ground /dedicated car bay and not during scheduled events (see working on car policy)
1. Position jack in recommended lift points under vehicle
1. Engage brakes (if applicable) or chocks 

Using:

1. Lift vehicle slowly and carefully
1. Always use jack stands to support a lifted vehicle
1. Remove handle when not in use (trip hazard)

After:

1. Release jack pressure slowly.

## EWP (Elevated Work Platform) ✔

Lead: Fletcher Boyd
Signed off by: Fletcher, Sophie

| Item  | Requirement | Notes  |
| - | - | - |
| Ear protection                 | N | Situational awareness when moving |
| Enclosed shoes                 | Y | Trip hazard |

Demonstrate:

1. Emergency descent 

Pre:

1. Check the condition of the platform and controls.
1. Do not operate when alone in workshop
1. Do not use side rails for lifting
1. Unplug charging cable

Using:

1. Plan path and clear obsticles before moving
1. Check weight of load before putting on front (max 40kg)
1. EWP will shift backwards slightly when moving from wheels to frame, plan accordingly
1. Platform should be raised onto frame before larger loads are added if going directly up
1. Position feet to back of platform when driving for more stability
1. Set desired operating mode (driving vs lifting)
1. Hold direction button
1. Slowly engage throttle
1. Operator responsibility to maintain situational awareness
1. Be careful when stepping off platform if loaded, may tip forward onto frame (solution is to prelift onto frame)
1. Monitor for low battery symptoms (extra whining, low output power)
1. Continue to monitor for attendees underneath when working at height

After:

1. Connect charger
1. Remove key

## Ladder

<!-- Once the documentation is complete and has been signed off etc add a ✓ to the tool name-->

Lead: Fletcher Boyd
Signed off by: Fletcher, ???

| Item  | Requirement | Notes  |
| - | - | - |
| Enclosed shoes                 | Y | Trip hazards |

Notes: Demonstrate how to safely mount/dismount from framed cladding area.

Pre:

1. Set ladder on even stable ground
1. Check that cross support (A-frame) or locking bar (extension) is engaged and functional
1. Plan operation and whether footing is required (any operation that moves the center of gravity outside the ladder footprint) or any use of the extension ladder
1. Use EWP where possible for item storage/retrieval instead of ladder
1. (Extension ladder) position ladder to brace top end under support if possible

Using:

1. Maintain three points of contact
1. (A-frame) Do not go above signed step when used as a normal A frame ladder (ie exception is when ladder is being used to access ceiling
1. Pass items to offsiders instead of lifting yourself

After:

1. Stow ladder back in designated spot

Advanced operations:

1. Using ladder to access ceiling spaces other than Design Lab/Rehearsal room (areas without framed cladding) - Where it's safe to walk, how to get up/down
1. Using ladder in coordination with EWP - Don't be on the ladder when people are driving
1. Operating tools or equipment while at height - Maintaining points of contact, tethered tools, footing safety, harness
1. Lifting items while climbing - Maintaining points of contact, manual handlling
1. Using ladder to access top of roof (ie where the sun hits) - Footing requirements, where it's safe to walk

Materials:
* Some materials may explode when over-compressed, e.g. wood, paper, string.
  * See e.g. [Hydraulic Press Channel - Crushing Book with Hydraulic Press](https://youtu.be/PmvKlnhMjUw?t=111).
* Do not compress springs or other objects that could be ejected from the press.
* Do not compress objects that could shatter.

Pre:

1. Check press for loose or damaged parts.
1. Consider safety of bystanders. (All bystanders need to be wearing appropriate PPE.)
1. Some parts being pressed may have a tendency to pop out of the press or explode under pressure. Protect yourself accordingly. Keep hands away from the pressure head and out of support rod holes. Always center the work piece on the table plates and center the pressure head on the work piece to prevent injury by ejection of the work piece.

Using:

1. Place the work piece on the table plates in the desired position ensuring the piece is stable.
1. Either fit a punch or remove the punch guide using the grub screw
1. Locate and close the release valve on the ram by turning it clockwise until tight.
1. Pump the handle until the ram nears the work piece.
1. Align the ram and work piece to ensure even central loading.
1. Apply the load to the work piece by pumping the handle. Do not overload the workpiece.
1. Remove the load from the work piece by turning the release valve counterclockwise. Stabilize the work piece so it does not fall while the pressure is released.
1. Remove the work piece after the ram is fully retracted.

After:

1. Return all pressing heads (tools), jack handles, table plates etc. to their proper places.
