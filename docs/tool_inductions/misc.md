| Gloves (general)               | M | Consider oil etc on vehicle |
| Enclosed shoes                 | Y |  |

Pre:

1. Verify jack capacity is greater than vehicle weight
1. Only on clear level ground /dedicated car bay and not during scheduled events (see working on car policy)
1. Position jack in recommended lift points under vehicle
1. Engage brakes (if applicable) or chocks 

Using:

1. Lift vehicle slowly and carefully
1. Always use jack stands to support a lifted vehicle
1. Remove handle when not in use (trip hazard)

After:

## EWP (Elevated Work Platform) ✔

Lead: Fletcher Boyd
Signed off by: Fletcher, Sophie

| Item  | Requirement | Notes  |
| - | - | - |
| Ear protection                 | N | Situational awareness when moving |
| Enclosed shoes                 | Y | Trip hazard |

Demonstrate:

1. Emergency descent 

Pre:

1. Check the condition of the platform and controls.
1. Do not operate when alone in workshop
1. Do not use side rails for lifting
1. Unplug charging cable

Using:

1. Plan path and clear obsticles before moving
1. Check weight of load before putting on front (max 40kg)
1. EWP will shift backwards slightly when moving from wheels to frame, plan accordingly

1. Position feet to back of platform when driving for more stability
1. Set desired operating mode (driving vs lifting)
1. Hold direction button
1. Slowly engage throttle
1. Operator responsibility to maintain situational awareness
1. Be careful when stepping off platform if loaded, may tip forward onto frame (solution is to prelift onto frame)
1. Monitor for low battery symptoms (extra whining, low output power)
1. Continue to monitor for attendees underneath when working at height

After:

1. Connect charger
1. Remove key

## Fire

Lead: Fletcher Boyd
Signed off by: Fletcher, ???

Topics to cover:

* Typically comes under [Dangerous Projects](/docs/policies/dangerous_projects) policy
* We direct users of some tools (angle grinder etc) to talk to a fire inducted person before doing jobs outside, this the induction to become one of the fire people.
* Where you cannot use fire
  * Within 3m of shed (flammable gas storage)
  * Within 3m of gas bottles anywhere in the workshop or surrounds (oxygen etc stored at welding bay) - It's okay to move bottles elsewhere to make it safe. Exception is if the gas bottles are the thing creating the fire. (forge, oxy etc)
  * Close to flammable material like carpets etc (Close depends on the operation, eg charring a steak can be closer than something that makes sparks)
  * In the carpark
  * Under the shade sails (if heat is more significant than a blowtorch or otherwise likely to damage the sails)
  * Around poorly supervised children
* Where you cannot create liquid metal above 500°C
  * Everywhere listed above
  * Concrete (Can cause minor explosions)
* What surfaces make good options for fire
  * Sand
  * Concrete (depending on heat)
  * Welding bench (depending on heat)
  * Not plastic tables
* PPE considerations
  * Natural fibres, we want clothing to burn not melt
  * Face shields (preferrably with metal grill) if dealing with a lot of direct heat
  * Long sleeves/pants
  * Work boots
* Firefighting options
  * Consider the type of fire you're creating, can it be put out with a powder exstinguisher? (fire type, will burning material be blown in all directions)
  * Fire exstinguishers
  * Fire blankets
  * Water
  * Fire hose
  * Sand bucket (metal/battery fires)
* When to pre-wet surroundings
* Do you need a spotter? (ie Wearing welding helmet etc that reduces visability)
* Is a permit required?
  * Permits not required for work enclosed inside (doors closed)
  * Permits required for outside work when a total fire ban is in place - Check on [DFES website](https://www.emergency.wa.gov.au/#totalfirebans) or call [1800 709 355](tel:1800709355) to check for TFB
  * Permits are not issued if the fire rating is Catastrophic
* Permitted works require: (Abbreviated to requirements that need to be accounted for at AF specifically)
  * Approval from a committee member to begin the process. Will need to justify why the works need to be done outside and why today.
  * [DFES notice](https://dfes.wa.gov.au/hazard-information/bushfire/total-fire-ban) at least 30 minutes before (max 24h)
  * 10m ground clearance of flammables
  * 10m wet down
  * Exstinguishers with a combined wieght of at least 18kg (2x9kg, 4x4.5 etc) - Our large exstinguishers are 9kg
  * Fire detection officer - must be exclusively dedicated to the detection and suppresion of fires and be trained to do so. Remain on duty for at least 30 minutes after the hot work is complete until they are sure there is no fire or anything likely to start one.
  * Fire detection officer is not a box ticking exercise - If not 100% confident defer to Fletcher or Lewis.

## Ladder ✓

<!-- Once the documentation is complete and has been signed off etc add a ✓ to the tool name-->

Lead: Fletcher Boyd
Signed off by: Fletcher, Renae

| Item  | Requirement | Notes  |
| - | - | - |
| Enclosed shoes                 | Y | Trip hazards |

Notes: Demonstrate how to safely mount/dismount from framed cladding area.

Pre:

1. Set ladder on even stable ground
1. Check that cross support (A-frame) or locking bar (extension) is engaged and functional
1. Plan operation and whether footing is required (any operation that moves the center of gravity outside the ladder footprint) or any use of the extension ladder
1. Use EWP where possible for item storage/retrieval instead of ladder
1. (Extension ladder) position ladder to brace top end under support if possible

Using:

1. Maintain three points of contact
1. (A-frame) Do not go above signed step when used as a normal A frame ladder (ie exception is when ladder is being used to access ceiling
1. Pass items to offsiders instead of lifting yourself

After:

1. Stow ladder back in designated spot

Advanced operations:

1. Using ladder to access ceiling spaces other than Design Lab/Rehearsal room (areas without framed cladding) - Where it's safe to walk, how to get up/down
1. Using ladder in coordination with EWP - Don't be on the ladder when people are driving
1. Operating tools or equipment while at height - Maintaining points of contact, tethered tools, footing safety, harness
1. Lifting items while climbing - Maintaining points of contact, manual handlling
1. Using ladder to access top of roof (ie where the sun hits) - Footing requirements, where it's safe to walk

Materials:
* Some materials may explode when over-compressed, e.g. wood, paper, string.
  * See e.g. [Hydraulic Press Channel - Crushing Book with Hydraulic Press](https://youtu.be/PmvKlnhMjUw?t=111).
* Do not compress springs or other objects that could be ejected from the press.
* Do not compress objects that could shatter.

Pre:

1. Check press for loose or damaged parts.
1. Consider safety of bystanders. (All bystanders need to be wearing appropriate PPE.)
1. Some parts being pressed may have a tendency to pop out of the press or explode under pressure. Protect yourself accordingly. Keep hands away from the pressure head and out of support rod holes. Always center the work piece on the table plates and center the pressure head on the work piece to prevent injury by ejection of the work piece.

Using:

1. Place the work piece on the table plates in the desired position ensuring the piece is stable.
1. Either fit a punch or remove the punch guide using the grub screw
1. Locate and close the release valve on the ram by turning it clockwise until tight.
1. Pump the handle until the ram nears the work piece.
1. Align the ram and work piece to ensure even central loading.
1. Apply the load to the work piece by pumping the handle. Do not overload the workpiece.
1. Remove the load from the work piece by turning the release valve counterclockwise. Stabilize the work piece so it does not fall while the pressure is released.
1. Remove the work piece after the ram is fully retracted.

After:

1. Return all pressing heads (tools), jack handles, table plates etc. to their proper places.

1. Light torch using lighter or flint (demonstrate both)
1. Adjust flame to desired length
1. Hottest part of flame is at the tip of the inner core
1. Heat part as required, consider smooth motion etc
1. Tipping the bottle upside down with dump contaminants into flame, less effective etc

After:

1. Turn off gas to put out, do not blow out flame
1. Everything is hot, let cool before putting away
1. Remove torch from bottle
