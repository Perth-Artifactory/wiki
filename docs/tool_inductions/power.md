## Router (Plunge)

| Item  | Requirement | Notes  |
| - | - | - |
| Eye protection (impact/splash) | Y | Flying chips |
| Ear protection                 | Y |  |
| Gloves (general)               | M | Both hands remain away from spinning parts during operation |
| Enclosed shoes                 | Y |  |
| Mask/Respirator (dust)         | M | Material dependant |

Note: Train operator to hollow out odd shape (draw a hexagon etc with marker on material as guide).

Allowed materials:

* Wood (Metal detected or direct from supplier)

Consumables:

* 1/2" router bits - Provided, operator can BYO (In yellow case above red toolbox in machine room)

Pre:

1. Select bit appropriate for desired cut
1. Fit bit to router
1. Set min/max depth plunge
1. Consider workholding, router has lots of sideways force and can shift material
1. Consider supporting ends of end grain to reduce tearout if going near the edge
1. Connect tool to power
1. Follow Using steps on scrap material before using on piece if not 100% confident on height setup

Using:

1. Both hands stay on handles during operation
1. Place router on material at minimum plunge
1. Turn on router
1. Slowly lower bit into material until desired depth is achieved
1. Use conventional cutting not climb cutting when not slot cutting (CCW outside, CW inside) - Demonstrate how to figure this out rather than rote learning
1. Adjust spindle speed based on cut

After:

1. Disconnect tool from power
1. Cleanup includes bench/ground, tool throws chips everywhere
1. Remove router bit (may still be hot), return to case
1. Leave collet nut loose (but on thread)

| Eye protection (impact/splash) | Y | Flying chips |
| Ear protection                 | Y |  |
| Gloves (general)               | N | Spinning bit close to hands |
| Enclosed shoes                 | Y |  |
| Mask/Respirator (dust)         | M | Material dependant |

Allowed materials:

* Wood (Metal detected or straight from supplier)

Consumables:

* 1/4" router bits with guide bearing - Provided, operator can BYO (In red toolbox in machine room)

Pre:

1. Select bit (guided bearing only)
1. Fit bit to router (spanner is attached to wooden block in bit drawer)
1. Unlock depth plate and adjust depth with roller, lock depth plate
1. Connect battery
1. Point away from people and turn on the router for a moment to confirm everything is working as expected
1. Consider workholding, router has lots of sideways force and can shift material
1. Consider supporting ends of end grain to reduce tearout
1. Follow Using steps on scrap material before using on piece if not 100% confident on height setup

Using:

1. Keep hand away from chip port at all times
1. Turn on router
1. Place on material with plate level
1. Slowly push router into material until bearing makes contact
1. Conventional cut around the piece (CCW outside, CW inside) - Demonstrate how to figure this out rather than rote learning
1. Can climb cut the last inch back to a corner if desired
1. Start with end grain first, other operations can be used to hide tear out

After:

1. Remove battery
1. Cleanup includes bench/ground, tool throws chips everywhere
1. Remove router bit (may still be hot), return to case
1. Leave collet nut loose (but on thread)

Advanced operations:

1. Using bits without guide bearings (usually better tool options)

| Mask/Respirator (dust)         | M | Material dependant |

Allowed materials:

* Wood (Metal detected or fresh from supplier)
* Plastic

Consumables:

* Saw blade - Provided (Fitted)

Pre:

1. Ensure blade is appropriate for material and cut type
1. Adjust blade angle
1. Adjust blade height so one gullet passes through material
1. Consider work holding, including pinching
1. Consider straight edge
1. Consider other side of material (since blade goes through)
1. Fit battery/plug in
1. Line intented cut up with blade mark on front of tool

Using:

1. Rest tool on surface of material so foot is level
1. One hand on trigger, other hand on secondary handle
1. Spin up tool completely before cutting
1. Cut in smooth motion, listen to motor load to judge feed speed
1. Back off and go slower if saw stalls

After:

1. Remove battery/unplug
1. Cleanup includes work surface, floor (if inside) and inside blade guard on tool

Advanced operations:

1. One handed operation
1. Blade changes

## Saw (Jigsaw)

| Item  | Requirement | Notes  |
| - | - | - |
| Eye protection (impact/splash) | Y | Flying chips |
| Ear protection                 | Y | Tool noise and resonating material |
| Gloves (general)               | M | Most cut items are sharp |
| Enclosed shoes                 | Y | Debris |
| Safety boots                   | M | Weight dependant |
| Mask/Respirator (dust)         | M | May produce irritating dust depending on material |

Allowed materials:

* Wood (Metal detected or fresh from supplier)
* Malleable plastic
* Metal

Specifically banned materials:

* Acrylic - impact can shatter material into pieces
* Glass and other brittle materials
* Ceramic/stone and other materials that require wet cutting

Consumables:

* Blades - Provided, can bring own (top of red machine room toolbox)


Pre:

1. Ensure selected blade is appropriate for cut type (metal=metal, wood=wood, plastic=wood) and desired cut radius (thinner=tighter).
1. Check blade for damage - report to infra
1. Fit blade to saw
1. Create hole with another tool if starting cut from the middle of the material.
1. Consider whether material will shift during/after cut, support appropriately 
1. Plug in tool, test that blade is fitted properly
1. Enable laser if using
1. Consider exclusion zone to protect bystanders

Using:

1. Ensure saw foot and blade is placed firmly against material (tool **should not** be running when cut begins)
1. Gently pull trigger to start cutting. Adjust speed based on confidence in control
1. Angle cut as required by job (assuming blade can handle it)
1. Be mindful that saw is travelling through material and can hit things on other side
1. Pause job if foot jumps off of material

After:

1. Debris are typically flung quite far - cleanup needs to be thorough
1. Blade is usually hot, allow to cool before removing
1. Check for blade damage - replace
1. Return blade to case if using AF
