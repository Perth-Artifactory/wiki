| Item  | Requirement | Notes  |
| - | - | - |
| Eye protection (impact/splash) | Y | Flying chips |
| Ear protection                 | Y | Tool noise and resonating material |
| Gloves (general)               | M | Most cut items are sharp |
| Enclosed shoes                 | Y | Debris |
| Safety boots                   | M | Weight dependant |
| Mask/Respirator (dust)         | M | May produce irritating dust depending on material |

Allowed materials:

* Wood (Metal detected or fresh from supplier)
* Malleable plastic
* Metal

Specifically banned materials:

* Acrylic - impact can shatter material into pieces
* Glass and other brittle materials
* Ceramic/stone and other materials that require wet cutting

Consumables:

* Blades - Provided, can bring own (top of red machine room toolbox)


Pre:

1. Ensure selected blade is appropriate for cut type (metal=metal, wood=wood, plastic=wood) and desired cut radius (thinner=tighter).
1. Fit blade to saw
1. Create hole with another tool if starting cut from the middle of the material.
1. Consider whether material will shift during/after cut, support appropriately 
1. Plug in tool, test that blade is fitted properly
1. Enable laser if using

Using:

1. Ensure saw foot and blade is placed firmly against material (tool **should not** be running when cut begins)
1. Gently pull trigger to start cutting. Adjust speed based on confidence in control
1. Angle cut as required by job (assuming blade can handle it)
1. Be mindful that saw is travelling through material and can hit things on other side
1. Pause job if foot jumps off of material

After:

1. Debris are typically flung quite far - cleanup needs to be thorough
1. Blade is usually hot, allow to cool before removing
1. Return blade to case if using AF

Consumables:

* Blades - Provided, can bring own (top of red machine room toolbox)


Pre:

1. Ensure selected blade is appropriate for cut type (metal=metal, wood=wood, plastic=wood, wood with nails=demo) and material depth.
1. Fit blade to saw
1. Select mode. Straight cut = slower but more control, circular = faster but less control
1. Create hole with another tool if starting cut from the middle of the material.
1. Consider whether material will shift during/after cut, support appropriately 
1. Fit battery to tool, test that blade is fitted properly

Using:

1. Ensure saw foot and blade is placed firmly against material (tool **should not** be running when cut begins)
1. One hand on the trigger, other hand behind the head of the tool
1. Gently pull trigger to start cutting. Adjust speed based on confidence in control
1. Angle cut as required by job (assuming blade can handle it)
1. Be mindful that saw is travelling through material and can hit things on other side
1. Pause job if foot jumps off of material
