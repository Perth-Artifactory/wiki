## Safety considerations

Sand blasting creates toxic dusts.
* Cement, stone, glass, pottery etc -> crystalline silica - causes silicosis
* Some blasting grits may also contain silica
* Lead paint -> lead
  * Refer [Worksafe QLD - Working with lead based paint](https://www.worksafe.qld.gov.au/safety-and-prevention/hazards/hazardous-exposures/lead/working-with-lead-based-paint)
  * Do not blast lead paint in our sand blaster - use an alternative means of paint stripping.
* Dust is harmful to breath but skin contact is typically okay

## Setup

* Ensure material is safe for sand blasting (see safety considerations)
* Remove cover from rear air inlet.
* Connect power to vacuum cleaner.
* Connect power to sand blaster cabinet. (Internal light.)
* Connect compressed air.
* Check grit level - must cover suction tube, but not vent tube.

## Operation

* Turn on vacuum cleaner
* Check vacuum cleaner is sucking.
* Load work (aluminium can is a good first object)
* Close and latch door
* Perform sand blasting
* Allow at least 10 seconds to extract dust, before opening door
* Dust may settle on part, consider hands soiled

## Cleanup

* Replace rear air inlet cover
* Clean up spilled dust / grit by wet wiping (e.g. wet paper towel) - Do not cause dust to become airborne. (no brushes or compressed air)

## Additional info

### Maintenance

Maintenance requires additional training/supervision

Wear respiratory protective equipment while maintaining the sand blaster or the vacuum cleaner.

For sand blaster - refer operators manual.

Internal screen protector (thin plastic sheet) should be replaced when it becomes hard to see through.
* Replacements available from Supercheap Auto (original) or Hare and Forbes (not original, but way cheaper - are they the same size?)

Vacuum cleaner bag - must be replaced when it gets full.

* Replacement bags are in the machine room shelving.
* !! If no replacement bag - tag the vacuum out of service. !!
* !! We ruined the first vacuum cleaner by operating it without a bag. !!

Blasting grit must be garnet with no crystalline silica impurities (check the MSDS).

* The machine needs about 10kg for a full load.
* Hare and Forbes sells [25kg bags of garnet grit](https://www.machineryhouse.com.au/sandblasting-beads) at reasonable prices.
* [Hare and Forbes MSDS for garnet grit](https://images.machineryhouse.com.au/products/S296/PDF/Garnet%20_Hare%20_%20Forbes__1687470138.pdf)
* Dispose of used grit by double-bagging before putting in the skip.
