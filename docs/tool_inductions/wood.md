Tool Familiarisation:

1. Tool requires dust extraction, currently set up for connecting to shop vac. 
1. Drum and belt are controlled separately. Show switches.
1. Show height control handle 
1. Open drum cover by pressing black knob and lifting cover.
1. THERE IS NO INTERLOCK on drum cover. Drum will spin if turned on with cover open.
1. Maximum use period 30 minutes. Then 5 minutes cooldown for tool and shop-vac required.

Pre-Start Checks - Material

1. Check material is apropriate for use on this tool (eg, no Sheoak)
1. Check any timber of unknown origin (eg, reclaimed timber) for nails or other metal with metal detector
1. Check for sharp edges sticking out from material that may damage the conveyor or drum sandpaper
1. Check material is already of even thickness by measuring four corners (run through thicknesser or other sander first if needed)


Pre-Start Checks - Tool

1. Check appropriate grit installed on drum
1. Check tension and condition of the sand paper
1. Check condition of conveyor
1. Check conveyor tracking by running conveyor at full speed and check for sideways movement. Tracking only to be adjusted by trainers. 
1. Check conveyor tension by slowing down conveyor. If conveyor can be stopped with hand presure it is too loose. Tension only to be adjusted by trainers.
1. Turn machine and conveyor off.

Using:

1. ensure material is stable on conveyer (bowing up/cupping down)
1. set depth of cut (open top and lower untill the drum contacts material but can still be spun by hand)
1. raise drum 1/4 turn and remove material.
1. close cover
1. connect shop-vac for dust extraction. 
1. start drum
1. start conveyer and adjust feed rate (suggest start at 30-40%)
1. turn on dust extraction
1. feed stock through machine
1. feed material at about 30 deg angle if possible to begin with, final passes with the grain (more effective material removal)
1. lower drum between each pass, 1/4 to max 1/2 handle turn per pass
1. repeat steps 6-9 until desired thickness reached
1. after every 30 mins of operation, turn off machine and dust extraction for minimum 5mins. Take this time to empty the shop vac.

After:

1. turn off drum and conveyer
1. vacuum/sweep/blow out all sawdust, including in the drum head
1. clean drum with sandpaper cleaning stick
1. clean up stick residue from conveyor.
1. Check shopvac and empty if more than 1/4 full. (fine dust, will effect performance and vacuum life more than normal sawdust.
