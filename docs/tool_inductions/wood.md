| Mask/Respirator (dust)         | M   | P2 if material is toxic (MDF etc) |

Materials: 

* Dry wood (Must be metal detected unless freshly purchased from Bunnings etc)
* Acrylic
* Green wood (With approval from infra - old/personal blade and detailed cleanup)
* Aluminium (With approval from infra - old/personal blade and detailed cleanup)

Consumables:

* General purpose 10mm 8TPI blade installed.

Notes:

* Report to infra if blade is blunt
* Spares kept in office.
* Other blades may be used (detail, resawing or green wood blades) but are not provided by the space. Renae has some that may be used by arrangement
* Specific training required to replace or change blade

Pre:

1. Check equipment prior to use (Blade sharpness, tension, and tracking)
1. Ensure work area is clear
1. Ensure tool is far enough from wall for length of cut/material (so it doesn't hit the wall)
1. Use proper blade for material and cut type
1. Check material for fixings (nails etc) using metal detector
1. Table positioning
1. Set blade guide height (No lock)
1. Fence positioning
1. Turn on dust extractor and set gates

Using:

1. Saw is more powerful than previous saw - will go through things quicker so don't put your fingers inline with the blade while applying force Also takes longer to spin up and stop.
1. Keep fingers away from blade path
1. Use push sticks for narrow pieces
1. Spin up completely before blade contacts material
1. Push gently, do not overload tool
1. Do not clear material from blade/fence with fingers

After:

1. Turn off using red button
1. Ensure blade comes to a complete stop before clearing waste or leaving machine
1. Turn off dust extractor with red button not estop
1. Dispose of off cuts (empty bin into skip if 3/4 full)
1. Check blade is clean (not clogged or covered in resin etc.)

Advanced operations:

* Specific training required for resawing thick pieces, adjusting guide bearings or changing/replacing blade.
* Changing/replacing blade - note - bearings will need to be adjusted.
* Resawing - will cause excessive wear to standard blade. Users may be required to purchase resaw blade or contribute to cost or extra wear on blade. Refer to Renae. Additional height fence may be needed for safe support.

Material: Timber and timber composites (mdf, chipboard etc) that are:

* Stable and sitting flat on the table
* Free of fixings (metal detected unless freshly purchased from Bunnings etc)

Supplied consumables: 1/2 router bits (stored in machine room) - report broken/damaged. Operators can bring their own 1/2" bits as desired.

Pre:

1. Raise machine onto wheels
1. Set up in appropriate position - consider kickback and safety of bystanders
1. Lower machine (Check for things that may be crushed etc)
1. Remove cover
1. Adjustment tools are stored on table saw cart
1. Check bit is appropriate for material (type) and intended cut (profile)
1. Inspect bit for damage (Cutting edge, bent)
1. Set bit to appropriate height/depth of cut for material (hardness) and tool profile (bit)
1. Lock the bit height using the lock hole

### SawStop safety feature

The machine continually monitors the capacitance/inductivity of the *blade* through the SawStop cartridge. When the sensed level rises quickly (indicating something has changed quickly) **and** greatly (indicating that something large has come in contact with/close to the blade) the system will trigger. If the saw is in bypass mode the green light will flash. If the saw is not in bypass mode (normal configuration) then an activation will forcefully stop the blade and lower it below the table to prevent injury.

* Anything electrically conductive can cause a trigger including (but not limited to): metal fixings, wet wood, sap
* In some instances sleds can interfere with this feature if put on the saw after a baseline reading is taken.
* Nails etc won't always trigger the safety since they don't increase the reading by a significant amount.
* Bypass mode can only realistically be used to test whether a particular material will trigger the safety if the triggering factor is the same throughout the material. ie, it can test if wood is too wet for normal operation but can't test for the presence of nails.
* A safety trigger is a **destructive process** and will destroy both the blade and the safety cartridge.
* ⚠️ Machine operators are financially responsible for all triggers. This includes the cartridge ($170+) and blade ($80-300). 
* Bypassing the safety monitoring can only be done under the direct supervision of a table saw trainer.

### Attachment options/considerations

* Fence (Specific setup if used with mitre guide)
* Mitre guide (Specific setup if used with fence)
* Cross cut sled (+stop block, usually put on before saw takes baseline reading)
* Push sticks
* Push blocks/Featherboard
* DRO
* Zero clearance inserts (Infra approval to cut new inserts)
* Stock guides (Set wheel height based on material not table)
* Tapering jig
* Dado blades (Supervised only)
* Bypass (Supervised only)

Pre:

1. Raise machine onto wheels
1. Set up in appropriate position - consider kickback and safety of bystanders
1. Lower machine (Check for things that may be crushed etc)
1. Remove cover
1. Check riving knife is installed (CRUCIAL)
1. Plan cut and fit attachments as appropriate
1. Check blade is square to attachments
1. Set blade height and angle 
1. Connect dust extractor
1. Material must have stable/flat base and at least one straight side. (unless jig is used)
1. Plug in saw

Using:

1. Turn on machine by setting toggle switch to up position
1. Wait for machine to take baseline reading (Until red light stops flashing)
1. Turn on dust extractor
1. Start saw by pulling red paddle out
1. Never freehand a cut
1. Feed material through smoothly - do not put hands in line of blade or above red insert
1. Consider kickback - keep area in line with blade clear.
1. Ensure blade comes to a complete stop before removing material or waste.

After:

1. Disconnect from power
1. Stow all attachments on cart if used
1. Clean all waste and sawdust from machine via vacuum or air-gun.
1. Be aware thin offcuts may be stuck in dust outlet - check and clear.
1. Stow stock guides on fence if used
1. Lower blade and reset to 90/0
1. Reset table insert to SawStop standard (not zero clearance)
1. Wipe down cast iron table with clean rag
1. Re-center fence over blade (leave unlocked)
1. Put cover back on
1. Put saw away (Lower back on to frame)
1. Sweep and clean up floor of dust and offcuts.
1. Do not leave long pieces sticking out from bins - put in skip.

Advanced operations:
Specific training required to change blade.
Resawing - supplementary fence and featherboards may be required
Plunge cuts - removal of riving knife would be required - immediate replacement crucial.
Dado blades
Cutting new zero clearance inserts

* Resin (fully cured)

Prohibited:

* Coated boards (eg. Formply, laminate)
* Coated wood (eg. paint, oil, shellac)
* Green or wet wood
* She-oak
* Plastic
* Metal

Consumables: 120 grit paper installed. 
Report if damaged/torn
Alternative grit paper may be installed with appropriate training

Tool Familiarisation:

1. Tool requires dust extraction
1. Drum and belt are controlled separately. Show switches. (belt won't run unless drum is on)
1. Show height control handle and DRO
1. Open drum cover by loosening silver knob and lifting cover.
1. ⚠️THERE IS NO INTERLOCK on drum cover. Drum will spin if turned on with cover open.

Pre-Start Checks - Material

1. Check material is appropriate for use on this tool (eg, no She-oak)
1. Check any timber of unknown origin (eg, reclaimed timber) for nails or other metal with metal detector
1. Check for sharp edges sticking out from material that may damage the conveyor or drum sandpaper
1. Check material is already of even thickness by measuring four corners (run through thicknesser or other sander first if needed)

Pre-Start Checks - Tool

1. Check appropriate grit installed on drum
1. Check tension and condition of the sand paper
1. Check condition of conveyor
1. Check conveyor tracking by running conveyor at full speed and check for sideways movement. Tracking only to be adjusted by trainers.
1. Check conveyor tension by slowing down conveyor. If conveyor can be stopped with hand pressure it is too loose. Tension only to be adjusted by trainers.
1. Turn machine and conveyor off.
1. Connect dust extraction

Using:

1. Ensure material is stable on conveyer (bowing up/cupping down)
1. Set depth of cut (open top and lower until the drum contacts material but can still be spun by hand)
1. Zero out DRO if using
1. Raise drum 1/4 turn and remove material.
1. Close cover
1. Turn on dust extraction
1. Start drum
1. Start conveyer and adjust feed rate (suggest start at 30-40%)
1. Feed stock through machine
1. Feed material at about 30° if possible to begin with, final passes with the grain (30° effective material removal, with grain cleaner)
1. Lower drum between each pass, 1/4 to max 1/2 handle turn per pass
1. Repeat steps 9-11 until desired thickness reached

After:

1. Turn off drum and conveyer
1. Vacuum/sweep/blow out all sawdust, including in the drum head
1. Clean drum with sandpaper cleaning stick
1. Clean up stick residue from conveyor.
1. Check dust extractor and empty if more than 3/4 full.

Advanced Operations.
Replacement of drum wrap apparently a giant pain. Men's shed gate this tool for that reason. 
Let Tool Lead know if required for ny reason.
No one has actually done this yet.

Material:
Dry timber only (no composites) - must be checked with metal detector
Must have at least one flat side.
No coating that may gum blades.

Consumables:
Inserts may be rotated or replaced as required by infra.
Users expected to report any damage or issues

Pre:

1. Consider safe placement (noisy machine requiring 3 phase power)
1. Raise infeed and outfeed arms to correct height and tighten bolts.
1. Connect dust extractor (Consider using swarf barrel for long sessions)
1. Warn other users in the workshop before starting the tool and give them an opportunity to don hearing protection
1. Run machine briefly to check it sounds right.

Using:

1. Turn on dust extractor
1. Gradually lower head as you feed material through - until contact is made.
1. Perform full pass at that height.
1. Allow rollers to feed material - do not force or thrust.
1. Lower head slightly after each pass.
1. Ensure even insert wear by using different sections for each pass
1. Be guided by sound as to how far to lower for each pass.
1. Support long material to reduce snipe.
1. Machine produces a lot of swarf, monitor dust collector levels and empty before bag gets full

After:

1. Disconnect dust extractor and empty bag if over half full
1. Empty swarf barrel if used
1. Clean all dust and chips from machine and floor.
1. Wipe down cast iron surface with clean rag
1. Return infeed/outfeed supports to lowered position.
