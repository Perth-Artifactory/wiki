| Eye protection (impact/splash) | Y   | Flying chips                      |
| Ear protection                 | M   | Material dependant                |

| Mask/Respirator (dust)         | M   | P2 if material is toxic (MDF etc) |

Materials: 
Dry wood or acrylic only. 
Metal detector must be used on timber unless freshly purchased from Bunnings etc.
Saw can be set up for green wood or aluminium with approval from infra by installing an old (aluminium) or personal blade, and completing detailed clean up.

Consumables: General purpose 10mm 8TPI blade installed.
Report to infra if blade is blunt
Spares kept in office.
Other blades may be used (detail, resawing or green wood blades) but are not provided by the space. Renae has some that may be used by arrangement
Specific training required to replace or change blade

Pre:

1. Check equipment prior to use (Blade sharpness, tension, and tracking)
1. Ensure work area is clear
1. Ensure tool is far enough from wall for length of cut/material (so it doesn't hit the wall)
1. Use proper blade for material and cut type
1. Check material for fixings (nails etc) using metal detector
1. Table positioning
1. Set blade guide height (No lock)
1. Fence positioning
1. Turn on dust extractor and set gates

Using:

1. Saw is more powerful than previous saw - will go through things quicker so don't put your fingers inline with the blade while applying force Also takes longer to spin up and stop.
1. Keep fingers away from blade path
1. Use push sticks for narrow pieces
1. Spin up completely before blade contacts material
1. Push gently, do not overload tool
1. Do not clear material from blade/fence with fingers

After:

1. Turn off using red button
1. Ensure blade comes to a complete stop before clearing waste or leaving machine
1. Turn off dust extractor with red button not estop
1. Dispose of off cuts (empty bin into skip if 3/4 full)
1. Check blade is clean (not clogged or covered in resin etc.)

Advanced operations. 
Specific training required for resawing thick pieces, adjusting guide bearings or changing/replacing blade.
Changing/replacing blade - note - bearings will need to be adjusted.
Resawing - will cause excessive wear to standard blade. Users may be required to purchase resaw blade or contribute to cost or extra wear on blade. Refer to Renae. Additional height fence may be needed for safe support.

1. Ensure fence/table is set to appropriate angle if using
1. Consider operator position (Is sitting down better due to angles/length of cut)
1. Turn on dust extractor and set gates

Using:

1. Do not force material into belt/disc
1. Move left/right as appropriate (explain center line on disc)
1. Do not angle material away from you on the belt (catches)
1. Consider how material is held and what happens if material catches
1. If material catches, do not try and retrieve with machine on

After:

1. Turn off dust extractor with red button not estop
1. Clean belt/disc if material building is noticeable (would you need to clean it if you started using the machine now)
1. Remove chair if used
1. Vacuuming includes: table, belt, under guard, floor

Advanced operations- specific training required before replacing belts.

Tool Familiarisation:

1. Tool requires dust extraction, or shop vac
1. Drum and belt are controlled separately. Show switches.
1. Show height control handle
1. Open drum cover by pressing black knob and lifting cover.
1. ⚠️THERE IS NO INTERLOCK on drum cover. Drum will spin if turned on with cover open.
1. Maximum use period 30 minutes if using shop-vac. Then 5 minutes cooldown for tool and shop-vac required.

Pre-Start Checks - Material

1. Check material is appropriate for use on this tool (eg, no She-oak)
1. Check any timber of unknown origin (eg, reclaimed timber) for nails or other metal with metal detector
1. Check for sharp edges sticking out from material that may damage the conveyor or drum sandpaper
1. Check material is already of even thickness by measuring four corners (run through thicknesser or other sander first if needed)

Pre-Start Checks - Tool

1. Check appropriate grit installed on drum
1. Check tension and condition of the sand paper
1. Check condition of conveyor
1. Check conveyor tracking by running conveyor at full speed and check for sideways movement. Tracking only to be adjusted by trainers.
1. Check conveyor tension by slowing down conveyor. If conveyor can be stopped with hand pressure it is too loose. Tension only to be adjusted by trainers.
1. Turn machine and conveyor off.

Using:

1. ensure material is stable on conveyer (bowing up/cupping down)
1. set depth of cut (open top and lower until the drum contacts material but can still be spun by hand)
1. raise drum 1/4 turn and remove material.
1. close cover
1. connect shop-vac for dust extraction.
1. start drum
1. start conveyer and adjust feed rate (suggest start at 30-40%)
1. turn on dust extraction
1. feed stock through machine
1. feed material at about 30 deg angle if possible to begin with, final passes with the grain (more effective material removal)
1. lower drum between each pass, 1/4 to max 1/2 handle turn per pass
1. repeat steps 6-9 until desired thickness reached
1. after every 30 mins of operation, turn off machine and dust extraction for minimum 5mins. Take this time to empty the shop vac.

After:

1. turn off drum and conveyer
1. vacuum/sweep/blow out all sawdust, including in the drum head
1. clean drum with sandpaper cleaning stick
1. clean up stick residue from conveyor.
1. Check shop vac and empty if more than 1/4 full. (fine dust, will effect performance and vacuum life more than normal sawdust.

Advanced Operations.
Replacement of drum wrap apparently a giant pain. Men's shed gate this tool for that reason. 
Let Tool Lead know if required for ny reason.
No one has actually done this yet.

| Safety boots                   | M           | Material weight dependant                         |
| Mask/Respirator (dust)         | M           | P2 if cutting material that should not be inhaled |

Material:
Dry timber only (no composites) - must be checked with metal detector
Must have at least one flat side.
No coating that may gum blades.

Consumables:
Blades may be rotated or replaced as required by infra.
Users expected to report any damage or issues

Pre:
1. Consider safe placement (noisy machine requiring 3 phase power)
1. Raise infeed and outfeed arms to correct height and tighten bolts.
1. Connect dust extractor
1. Run machine briefly to check it sounds right.

Using:
1. Gradually raise table as you feed material through - until contact is made
1. Allow rollers to feed material - do not force or thrust
1. Raise table slightly after each pass
1. Be guided by sound as to how far to raise for each pass.
1. Support long material to reduce snipe.

After:
1. Disconnect dust extractor and empty bag if over half full
1. Clean all dust and chips from machine and floor.
1. Return infeed/ouutfeed supports to lowered position.

Advanced operations
Material with no flat side may be processed by use of feed plate and shims.
Replacing/rotating blades - refer infra

Material:
Dry timber only (no composites) - must be checked with metal detector
Must have at least one flat side.
No coating that may gum blades.

Consumables:
Blades may be sharpened or replaced as required by infra.
Users expected to report any damage or issues

Pre:
1. Consider safe placement (noise/mess)
