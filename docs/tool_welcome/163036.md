Here are some key points from your induction to keep in mind:

* This sign off covered the Anycubic Mono X and the Phrozen Mega 8K, no other printers.
* Always wear gloves when handling resin (including resin tools and uncured prints)
* It is your responsibility to ensure the build plate and vat are clean at the end of your print.
* Resin is not BYO, prices are [here](https://wiki.artifactory.org.au/en/docs/policies/fees).
* If there's a problem with a printer head to #3d-printing
