Welcome to 3D printing at the Artifactory! Here are some key points from your induction to keep in mind:

* This sign off covered the Bambu Labs P1S and X1C, no other printers.
* Filament is not BYO, prices are [here](https://wiki.artifactory.org.au/en/docs/policies/fees).
* Your cleared to use PLA and PETG filament, reach out to a trainer for other materials.
* Smooth beds are PLA only, the gold textured beds are fine for both PLA and PETG.
* If there's a problem with a printer head to #3d-printing
