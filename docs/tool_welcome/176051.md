Here are some key points from your induction to keep in mind:

* This sign off covered the Bambu Labs A1 and A1 Minis, no other printers.
* Where possible consider using the A1 Minis, this frees up other printers for prints that need them.
* Filament is not BYO, prices are [here](https://wiki.artifactory.org.au/en/docs/policies/fees).
* Your cleared to use PLA and PETG filament, reach out to a trainer for other materials.
* Smooth beds are PLA only, the gold textured beds are fine for both PLA and PETG.
* If there's a problem with a printer head to #3d-printing
