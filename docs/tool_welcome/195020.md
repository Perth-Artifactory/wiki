Here are some key points from your induction to keep in mind:

* This sign off covered the Sovol SV08 Max, no other printers.
* This printer is slower than the Bambu Labs printers and is really only for large prints.
* If your print can fit on a smaller printer, you're better off waiting for that one instead.
* Filament is not BYO, prices are [here](https://wiki.artifactory.org.au/en/docs/policies/fees).
* If there's a problem with a printer head to #3d-printing
