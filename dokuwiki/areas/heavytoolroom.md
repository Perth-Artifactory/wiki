# Heavy Tool Room (Machine Room)

The place for using tools that are not *too* dusty. (Take really dusty tools outside)

## Area Rules

The following rules apply to activities in the toolroom

1.  Clean up after yourself. This especially includes getting rid of swarf/sawdust
2.  Do not use a tool unless you know how to use it. Seek help if you need it.
3.  Everything on the shelves, or on the drill bit cabinet is for general use. This includes drill bits, fasteners and tools. If you have stuff in there that you don't want people using, you need to store it someplace else
4.  The tool room is not a place for materials storage.
5.  All Dremel-related items go under the main workbench. Put them back when you're done.
6.  Anything left out will be assumed to be a donation to space and stored on the shelves for general use. You have exactly as long as it takes for someone else to find it and use it to rescue it.

## Tools Available

Please see [start](/tools/start) for a list of all the tools. Available in the tool room are:

### Dremel

A fairly large selection of Dremel tools is kept under the main workbench.

### Clamps

A fairly wide variety. Larger ones are stored on a board near the entrance, smaller ones will be in a drawer in the Machine Room.

### Fasteners

Screws, nails, nuts, bolts and miscellaneous small items are either being stored in a drawer in the machine room, or will be. This is a work in progress.
