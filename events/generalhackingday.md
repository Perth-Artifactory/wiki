# General Hacking Day

Every Saturday members flock to the Artifactory to get noisy, dirty and ambitious with the Big Tools. A full weekend day affords us the time and lack of noise restrictions to build things that simply can't be done after work on weeknights, so expect to see plenty of sawdust and swarf flying, painting, hammering, soldering and much more. Throughout the day different people drop in and out, and so it's an excellent day to see a real cross section of the projects and people who are involved.

Casual use is also possible - check our website for costs <http://artifactory.org.au/membership/>
