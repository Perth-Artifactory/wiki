### Want to hold an Event/Workshop at The Artifactory

Running an event/workshop at the Artifactory is super easy and you don't even need to be a member to do it.  Over a quarter of 230+ events/workshops in 2018 were run by external groups/persons. 

Technology workshops, seminars, art exhibitions, lectures – all possible. Big doofs, club nights, etc – not so much. We’re a busy workshop with a limited performance area and restricted hours in which we can run such events. People can get overexcited when they hear “hacker warehouse in industrial area with cool gadgets”. Max capacity is 50(up to 100 if toilets are hired) people for any event. Currently we must operate under the small cultural event licensing exemption rules, and thus we can only serve alcohol from 6pm to 10pm, with under 50 people present. Events must also be themed in a manner consistent with our constitution – to encourage technological and/or maker creativity. We encourage you to VISIT the space to see what it’s like.

If the event does not require exclusive access of the Artifactory or hinder making/noise from members, cost is usually charged at \$10 per non-members of the Artifactory. For enquiries, contact info@artifactory.org.au or come to a Wednesday evening event and track down a committee member to discuss you idea.
