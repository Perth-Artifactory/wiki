### NoizeMaschin!!

FOR UP TO DATE NOIZEMASHIN!! - <http://www.noizemaschin.com/>

An evening of experimental music and video, tending towards Noise. We have a warehouse in an industrial area - so no noise restrictions! woohoo...

Our format is designed to give many performers exposure and maximise variety for the audience by limiting performance to 10 minute sets which overlap slightly. At the end there is an opportunity for a group jam.

Organisers:

-   General: [SKoT McDonald](/User/SKoT) (Artifactory & FXpansion)
-   Music curator is Sam Gillies (WAAPA & RTR-FM Difficult Listening).

Please email Sam if you want to perform a musical work (sam AT samgillies DOT com), otherwise write to skot AT vellocet DOT com or info@artifactory.org.au.

Warehouses in industrial estates are made for making Noise. So let's do it! The Artifactory's inaugural Noise gig / workshop / jam will allow some crazy sounds to be played at high volume, in the neat-o surrounds of the Artifactory's usual assortment of robot tools, high voltage dubious experiments and other assorted oddness.

5-10 minute sets are played one after another with each artist contributing 2-3 sets over the evening, allowing for interplay between artists during the changeover.

Cost: Free for Artifactory Members, \$10 in the tin for others to help us keep the space going and help us save up for a bigger and better PA + lights. You'll get to use it, it's a good cause. :)

BYO bottle and ear plugs.

Next Event: <http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=182185155176045>

Line up:

Sam Gillies - New noise set using effect nastiness in a much abused BFD2 plugin. Oh the terror we wreak during beta testing. Hear why he is a DJ of RTR's Difficult Listening.

SKoT McDonald - DePhazor - low level manipulation of 'massively' sized FFTs allows for evolving soundscapes almost without perceivable time. And other oddities. (Original credit for the first dephazor: Scott McNabb).

Mitchell Mollison - WASO's darling child of orchestration shakes off his classical chops for some music concrete madness.

Chris Arnold "The Mystery Producer" - Live abused live.

hmmm dpt - New Noise-Dance project is ready for some dope ass gigs!

Michael Terren - The figurehead of the Perth indie culture shakes his image and rattles his fans with something appropriately loud, noisy and aggressive.

Salamander - Fusing laptop electronics with analogue fx processing and live instrumentation (Tibetan singing bowls, trumpet), Salamander will be digging their teeth into a host of new soundworlds, with drums set to 500bpm.

Henry Anderson - Former Dyonysis frontman-come-laptop fanatic, intellectual heavy-weight and sexual prodigy does a set so inconceivably cool, it will be perceived as noise to all but the greatest connoisseurs.

I.n0jaQ - I.n0jaQ will be dusting off 1950s tube radios, 60s tape reverbs, 70s preset rhythm boxes, 80s educational machines and 90s found electronics. The unmistakable warm tone of last century's analogue circuitry intensely over-driven to timeless noise brutality levels.

Stewbags - Abusing the obscure all-analogue guitar effects rack box, the DUE-400. A blast from the 80s past!
