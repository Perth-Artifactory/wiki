Sound Absorption Panels are great for killing acoustic reflections, killing ambient sound from the outside world (if stuck over windows), and "deadening" your mixing environment. You could even make a ghetto vocal booth on the cheap.

### Materials

-   1 x 1160x580x90mm domestic insulation batt
-   2 x 1998x90x19mm pine (get 3 x 1.2m 90x19mm from Bunnings for this and below) (LONG SIDES)
-   2 x 580x90x19mm pine (SHORT SIDES)
-   8 x SKoT's perfectly practical patent-worthy laser-cut MDF corner braces (See "CornerBraces.DXF" in MemberWork/SKoT for dxf file for laser cutter)
-   32 x nails, around 30-40mm
-   \~1600mm x 1200mm calico (Spotlight has rolls of 10m for "cheap")
-   1 x staple gun

### Steps:

-   Mark out and cut 1.2m pine to lengths 2x1998 and 2x580. Remember saw will remove 3-4mm. Cut on WASTE side of line! Measure the 2 580mm bits from each end. 1.2m pine from Bunnings will typically be 1206mm or something.
-   Nail corner braces on both sides of both ends of LONG SIDE pine. Note corver braces have exact 19mm ends to help line up with pine. Note that pre-lasered nail holes should line up with "big spacing" along long side pine. HINT: bang nails on concrete floor of artifactory, MUCH EASIER.
-   Attach short sides to braces. Use set-square to ensure 90 degrees.
-   Staple calico along one long side and stretch over to other side. Staple to other side. Do not over-stretch - will bend pine, and rip calico. Taut, but not trampoline-worthy. Best to do corners with tension, then mid points, then quarters, then eighths.
-   Flip frame over to make "Calico bathtub" (calico on bottom)
-   Insert insulation Batt. Use gloves, as rockwool is ichy. Not dangerous these days, but irritating.
-   Fold calico over top of Batt, and staple opposite side, leaving 1-2cm as a hem-flap fold hem over, and staple.
-   Now stretch calico over short-ends of frame - just 1cm or so - and staple down.
-   Finally, fold calico at frame vertices into "hospital corners" (like you are wrapping xmas present) and staple down. This isn't just to be OCD / Neat - will stop calico catching on stuff.

Done!

**Q: Why Calico? What other materials possible?** The material needs to be "sound-transparent". You need to be able to breathe through it - to allow sounds to pass through and get absorbed by the Batt and not reflect. Any material you can suck air through is fine.

**Q: Can I stencil / spray paint my calico?** Yes, just don't cover all the material with a hard shiny paint surface.

Cool tips:

-   Add LED strip backlighting and mount panel 5cm out from the wall.
-   Suspending panels from your studio ceiling will tame reflections too.
-   Put panels behind your monitor speakers as well as on the wall opposite your speakers. Panels to the left and right of your mixing station lined up with your ears also a good idea.
