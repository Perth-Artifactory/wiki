## Minutes

### Previous meeting minutes

- No minutes from the last AGM as the last "AGM" was a founding meeting
  - Lack of minutes accepted informally

### Annual Report

#### Committee Report

- Reading off the Annual Report - thanking the founding committee
- Specific thanks to Karl who has gotten busy but was instrumental in founding

#### Changes to the space

- Thanks to SM and KB for selecting and arranging the venue
- Addition of giant robot and the bar d' factory
- Furniture, networking etc.
- On-line presence.
- Power subcommittee looked at upgrading the power, but the move has precluded this.

#### Artifactory will have to move

- Council zoning not appropriate for us.
- No heavy machinery use can occur after the 14th.
- Also "light use" of the venue after the 14th (essentially, just for warehousing)
- Understood that the main problem is the parking.
- Town of Vincent doesn't appear to be interested in helping us re-zone

#### New Premises

- looking at somewhere "central"
- Osborne Park because it's reasonably close to public transport and freeway access
  - One venue is 300 Square meters
  - Another is 330 Square Meters (and a mezzanine)
- Both sites are more expensive.
- Current Premises is \$2150, New Premises will be about \$3000 (per month)
- Possible reduction in price as long as we take a long lease
- Discussion about funding sources - we are privately funded so far.

#### Membership

- Membership drive will be required to pay for new Premises
- New year will stick with the membership structure - the current levels will not change.
- Proposed addition however, of a "Dedicated Space" Membership
  - \$200 per Month
  - Consists of an amount of physical floor space to be determined in addition to the privileges of the \$100 membership level.

#### Major Projects

- Infrastructure projects - Power, Safety, Security.
  - Due to venue change and difficulty, the Power and Security upgrades were shelved.
- Swarf-o_mat
  - Continues to be worked on (mainly by SM)
  - Other CnC machines being constructed
- RepRap
  - "Mendel" RepRap is now complete.
- Stratosphere Project
  - Stalled due to KB being busy with "Real Life"â„¢
- Midi Controlled Jacob's Ladder (Mr. Zappy)
  - Now supports note roll off!
  - Production on it should be ready to begin this week
- Excellent year in terms of "producing awesome stuff"
- Due to the amount of infrastructure already built, next year will be more awesome
- Grants have proven difficult to get so far
  - Australia Council grants appear to be where we need to be applying
  - State programs appear to be mainly interested in funding existing artists
  - Local Council grants need to be looked at, Stirling council may be more useful (which is good because Osborne Park is in Stirling council)

#### Events held in space

- Lots of Regular events
  - New space will be better because of the Zoning
- RepRap and Electronics and retro computing on Mondays
  - We have a RepRap now!
- Wine and Design night on Wednesday

  - Not so well attended
- Possible Model Rocketry night?
- What activities used for membership drives?
  - Sun fair stall
  - Crafternoon
  - Swancon Demonstration
  - Open day (including Rube Goldberg Competition)
- Perhaps we should come up with a mobile promo kit?
- Amateur Radio Course

#### Alumni Membership?

- Membership for people who can't physically access the site.
- No rights in terms of access to the space, but a way of them to continue supporting the Artifactory and allowing access to the mailing list, wiki etc.

#### Move that the report be accepted

- Unanimously accepted by proxies and members present

### Financial Report

- Available on the Google Group (<http://artifactory-core.googlegroups.com/web/Accounts+2009-2010.pdf>).
- Figures cover from September 2009 to June 2010.
- 24 Members at the end of June 2010, 17 were full members, 6 were associate members and 1 was student associate.
- Bond for the new venue (approximately \$9000) shouldn't be a problem.
- The first few months could be difficult though (need more members).
- We don't think we need to do a tax return, but it might be possible to claim the GST back.

- Move that we accept the financial report, PD seconds
  - Carried, everyone votes aye, except for Michel Ludwig

#### Corporate Sponsorship
