       * There were no objections and the 10 nominated members were elected unanimously on a show of hands.

-   6\. Other business
    -   Update about the current building lease issues (we have no lease and are paying month by month). The landlord has not come back to us following our request for either a reduction in rent or a rent holiday.
    -   Discussion about the potential for moving to new premises:
        -   Costs of moving vs benefits (direct costs, and indirect costs such as loss of members and time when the space is unavailable vs potential gain of members due to a new/better location)
        -   We currently have access to someone with a truck who could assist our move.
        -   Falling rental market means if we continue to pay commercial rates, it is the best time to get a good price.
        -   We should be looking for a place with both offices and a workshop area. We also require an industrial (or light industrial) area or one which allows us to make noise.
        -   City of Stirling knows us and has made available special zoning. This would have to be repeated if we move out of this shire.
    -   Potential water ingress issues. Sandbagging has been required once in the past. Current pump is not operable from the generator we have. Would damage caused be recoverable (insurance/landlord)?
    -   Do we need our records audited? After some discussion about this, it was moved by SteveH that "We do not need an external Audit". This was seconded by Jean-Michel and unanimously passed without dissent.
