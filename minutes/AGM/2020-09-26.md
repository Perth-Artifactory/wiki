Items that do not require special resolutions, but are considered worthwhile to discuss with the General Membership.w

### Resident Artist

Background: This is part of trying to gain deductible gift recipient status. Expanding the resident artist program would help support an application.

Proposal: Expand the resident artist program to include other types of visual artist etc. Expectation of \~5 simultaneous artists.

### Code of Conduct

Probably about time to make a code of conduct. While we do already have disciplinary systems to respond to problems, some new people look for spaces with a code of conduct. Having a code of conduct would make it clearer.

1.  This will primarily be concerned with the interactions between members, not between members and the tools/space.
2.  Not to be used as a stick to beat people.
3.  Most divisive parts of codes of conduct tend to be the 'enforcement' systems (e.g. 3 strikes). Plan to avoid that is to not change that at all.
