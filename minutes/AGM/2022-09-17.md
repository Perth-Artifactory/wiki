### Special Resolutions

Other business of which notice has been given as per the rules

#### Constitutional Amendment Proposal: financial standing fix

Article 12.6 reads:

    12.6    If a person who has ceased to be a member under rule (12.5) offers to pay the annual membership fee after the period referred to in that rule has expired

Section 12 otherwise indicates that the fee schedule is set by the Management Committee/AGM. The word annual should be replaced as it places an unintended restriction on our ability to bring members into good financial standing.

Motion: Amend article 12.6 to read:

    12.6    If a person who has ceased to be a member under rule (12.5) offers to pay the appropriate membership fee relevant to their membership level  after the period referred to in that rule has expired
