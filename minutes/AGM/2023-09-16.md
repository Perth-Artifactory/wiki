### Special resolution - Amendment to subrule 9.1 of the constitution

> **Explanation of proposed subrule 9.1.f**
> 
> The existing subrule 9.1 lists five ways in which memberships end. 
> 
> Most memberships end when the member resigns or stops paying the membership fees. However  sponsored members never had any fees to pay, so their memberships technically never ended unless they resigned. 
> 
> The proposed subrule 9.1.f. explicitly provides for free and sponsored memberships to end after a fixed term, as intended.
