# Committee Meeting 2010.09.21

Agenda

Property Stuff

-   Possible warehouse in Osbourne Park for 24k/yr - waiting to hear back so we can go see.

Finance Stuff:

-   Chairman's ID -\> Paypal with Great Urgency (we have fees in limbo there)
-   Overdue fees protocol - when Treasurer went to pay rent last month, we had 1400 owing (2/3 of which by committee members), which sucked, and he couldn't pay. Still need to scrape together the extra outgoings bill too (\$700)
-   Paypal commission - should we absorb the 1.6% commission, or add it to fees?
-   Bank: empty, once this month's rent and insurance are paid.
