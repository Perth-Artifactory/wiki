    2.  PD talked with Jenna and Michelle about setting up some small, short-term, rotating and theme-based Artifactory residencies-cum-remote sites that would be hosted by other interested organisations (e.g. Fremantle Arts Centre, Remida, etc.). Potential themes include 3D printing, circuit hacking/microcontroller, and computer music/arcophoning workshops; these workshops could adopt a similar fee structure to our themed nights, with proceeds shared between the Artifactory and the host organisations. Not only would these workshops (and the presence of Artifactory machines and equipment) bring additional people into the host organisations, but they would likely lead to more people joining the Artifactory. More to come.
    3.  Gossip: We made Hackaday/ Makezine.com, website hits up an order of magnitude.
    4.  Running arts focused workshops - Michelle keen, 6-8 week lead time.
