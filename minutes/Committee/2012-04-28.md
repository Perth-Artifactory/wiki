-   Public building safety regulations issues still open: Anton, Jason and Skot to try for an initial meeting with City of Stirling
    -   not enough to say that we haven't made any changes to the electrics --- need an electrician to inspect and sign off that we meet public safety regulations

    -   plans ahead: let them know that we want to comply but we're going through a bunch of changes: we're going to move equipment into machine room, chase up electrics --- need working groups to help with the moving of equipment, chasing up of certification
    -   factors affecting the maximum number is related to (a) square meterage, (b) the number of toilets, (c) the number and size of exits

    -   it's problematic however, as it has limited power (just two GPOs)
    -   from a dust-supression point of view, it's great, from a noise-reduction point of view, it needs major insulation work (and the ceiling needs some reinforcement)

### AudioVault taking on of space
