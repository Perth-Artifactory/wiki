### Correspondence

1.  Minimal official communication with City of Stirling --- turns out they do have the floor plans

### Property Report

1.  Public space licence is still pending a suitable electrician. AL has spoken to nine electricians, but have had problems with some of them turning up or providing quotes. Currently looking at a quote of \$900. Have also received advice on smoke detectors from a friendly electrician --- we can probably get away with battery powered smoke detectors and isolate the one closest to the stage during shows
    1.  **Proposal**: approve the \$900 spend re: inspection. Skot moves, SK seconds

    1.  Should we get a larger/proper/compliant first aid kit? (A St Johns one \[which simplifies restocking\] or a custom one)
    2.  The blurry line between the spirit of the Artifactory as a hacker-/maker-space, an experimental music events venue and a party/entertainment space was discussed
