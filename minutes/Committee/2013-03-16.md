### Agenda Items

#### Lotterywest

-   Our grant is going in the next meeting, not this one.. we are getting coaching on how to make our application all gold-star-worthy. The document ultimately gets signed by the premier.
-   we have an asset list now that makes everything look rosy!
-   Lotterywest gives out something like \$10million per month
-   it is not frowned upon to ask for organisational structuring grant - to get financials all sorted.

#### City of Stirling

-   Skot has been communicating intently (noted and much appreciated!!), good chat with rob Mccarthy of Men’s Shed
-   Geoff Wyber actually got back to Skot, there is a log of the entire saga on the wiki. <http://wiki.artifactory.org.au/doku.php?id=committee:stirling_city_saga>

#### General Business

-   Skot wants more people to be aware that they can just call Instant Waste to collect to skip, need to print brief instructions for the pinboard.
-   How do we encourage drinks runs so it's not drinks-run chicken between Skot and Jason.. mailout first to avoid double-ups.
-   Do a callout for quartermaster to handle supplies.
-   There is not much communication between committee members. Skot wonders if it's hitting spam filters. It is not.
-   Brendan proposes that we design a software solution for membership tracking etc and apply for a grant and get it built and open-sourced so that other spaces can use it.
-   Daniel and Brett to consult the other hackerspaces.
-   The last few months have been eerily quiet due mostly to temperature and Skot is wondering if we should open up the space to associate members during certain times.. we won't get a roster off the ground.
-   remind people to mailout when they will be in the space, advertising that the space will be open.
-   discussion about allowing all associates access to the space, what would happen when people drop to associate realising that it’s all the same.. If we give associates full access and make all memberships \$70, then \$40 concession and then day rates. (People can stay on 100 and be a supporter)
-   Brendan more keen to do it if we know we're definitely getting a laser cutter.
-   Skot to write up a draft proposal re flattening rates for the membership.
