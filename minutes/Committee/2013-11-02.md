##### Past report

\* NoizeMaschin!! \#28 - Halloween Special! <https://www.facebook.com/events/593866854010076>, raised \$310 as reported by SKoT to the committee list on 2013-10-30 .

     * Net stock movement: +1 carton (mostly cider), -3 bottles of red, +1 bottle of white. 4 bottle of water handed out (for ticket price, we should spot people water - looks good for RSA, and summer in artifactory is bonkers for dehydration)
     * Net boost to float after reimbursement of expenses: $310.

##### Upcoming

\* ADUG: Australian Delphi Users Group, Tuesday 2013-11-19-1900 \* ACTION: SKoT will check Audiovault's Google Calendar

-   Fragile laser tube, installing it Monday, AdamF will be present
    -   Then the key goes into the safe
-   Ongoing expenses: Depreciation of laser tube, whitelisted materials bank
-   Training sessions?
    -   Hourly cost? Big and small
    -   Can usage times be automatically logged, a la Mach3? how about UP's ?
-   We may need to register with the Radiological Council: \$70, once off

##### Toolroom rebuild

-   Daniel posted the plans: [tool_room_v2](/projects/tool_room_v2)
-   \~\$3000
-   Engineering report for council signoff
-   Stirling Council interactions do not directly affect the timing. In order to be assigned a building capacity number/rating we will need:
    1.  Approval: Planning zoning approval for us to exist and operate (now waiting on the council for this step)
    2.  Approval: Building compliance (we do not plan to be evaluated as is, this will be with the current toolroom demolished and incorporating the planned or completed new internal construction)
    3.  Approval: Health compliance certificate

    -   -\> not in the foreseeable future

##### Crowdfunding

-   One big fundathon. Stretch goals as we go.
    1.  Laser fees and sundries
    2.  [tool_room_v2](/projects/tool_room_v2)
    3.  [solar_power](/projects/solar_power) - if we get this far, this will reduce our ongoing power costs
        -   Expected cost: \~\$7000
        -   We still get the big rebates, they would pay for themselves in \~3 years
-   ACTION: SKoT handing over to Elena? Run Pozible campaign, set it up
-   Treasurer: Our campaign incentives have to be good value for us, timewise and moneywise
