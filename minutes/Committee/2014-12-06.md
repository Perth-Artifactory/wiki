### Agenda Items

-   SM: [Stirling City](Stirling City Saga): good news!
    -   Stirling are prepared to give us a conditional occupancy of 100 people for events if the roller door is open, 50 people at other times, so our need for a second fire escape is no longer a blocking item!
    -   Requires the TODO items, then an formal survey by Ray Barron (\~\$1000), then submitted to council
    -   RC rated capacity number can be 50 anytime
    -   Capacity for the square meterage would usually be 170
    -   \$200-\$500 for portapotty hire
    -   Things that need doing:
        -   exit light needs illuminating (battery replaced?) - design is fine
        -   "No Escape" signs over both rear doors, as they only go to a closed courtyard
        -   fire extinguishers need tags
        -   carpet edges need to be pinned down in some way so as not to be a trip hazard
        -   spray paints and flammables into metal cabinet
        -   stage curtains were inappropriate material - fixed/replacable
    -   They were ok with escape from tool room and offices as they stand due to low "workshop mode" occupancy
