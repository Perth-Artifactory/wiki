### Agenda Items

\* First New member / Open day was good. Next Open Day planning....

1.  Success

\* Internal space clutter - too much furniture, too many trolleys, too much storage. We've done well taming the carpark and back yard, now onto the inside again. \* Refreshing area hosts \* Office AC + power - it is proposed that offices / music room are left to fend for themselves rather than find the fault with the Big A/C's tripping power supply....?

-   SM moves we don't fix, and room users can supply through wall box aircon if desired. TG Second. Passed without dissent.

\* Property / Venue planning. (9 months till lease expires?)

      - Tim & SKoT visited a site in Burswood - Vic Park Collective "Kool Rooms" - there is a warehouse opposite going. Investigating. Dan Brown: Would we entertain Artifactory A/B? General support, still in embryonic stages.
      - SKoT & Nick attended Midland group "Cornwwll House" meeting. My 2c: not worth pursuing. They need to find big bucks, are fragmented, sub groups losing interest, the site is on the fringes of the city, and years from being ready. Many members have expressed to me they would not follow Artifactory out to midland.

### General Business

-   Sttuart McDonald wants to replace toilet seats. DB wants to replace whole cistern. DB will fund one, and post to list to steeple fund 2nd one.
-   NB retured large argon bottle.

### ACTION Items Resulting

-   TG to put call out to area hosts. SH elec, DB, Kitchen. SM Swarfomat/stage
-   SM to review prospectus and contact Kool Room to arrange followup
-   NB to contact ADUG and ask if they're OK with us promoting their event to raise activity profile of the space.
-   SM to action ADUG Promo pending NB's feedback.
-   SM to sort our NM and Space t-shirts
