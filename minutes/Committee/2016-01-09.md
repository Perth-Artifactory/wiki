### Previous ACTION Items Status

**1/ Eftpos Facilities**

      * NAB (Our Bank) seems to be the cheapest of the majors. (Checked - CBA, BankWest, ANZ, Westpac)

    *Option 1 - Eftpos Terminal
      *$40 per month. 
      *Once turnover hits 1500. 
      *1.5% transaction fee. For Visa, MasterCard, UnionPay, International, Eftpos.
      *As we wouldn't have that much.  Say $500 at the tops.  Then that $40 translates into 8% cost.

    *Option 2 - Card Reader that connects to a smart phone. NAB
      *Monthly fee $10
      *Credit Cards 2.1% of turnover.
      *Eftpos Transaction fee of 40c
      *Up front cost is $100
      *Downside to this is someone needs to provide a phone and have software installed to use this. 
      *for $500 put through terminal. Costs of about $20. 4%. (Monthly fee $10, 5*eftpos, $400*0.21)

    *I'd(STUART) prefer option 1 if we need a terminal, I will not provided my phone for option 2. 

    *Option 3 - "Paypal Here" terminal https://www.paypal.com.au/here
      * $150 from Officeworks
      * Paypass/Paywave "tap and go"
      * "Accept MasterCard, Visa and American Express debit and credit card payments quickly and securely, wherever you are. You can also send receipts, view your sales history, process refunds, and view and withdraw your balance, all from your mobile"
