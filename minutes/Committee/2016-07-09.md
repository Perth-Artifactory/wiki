### Property Report

-   Property discussions: We have proposed a 6month rent free period and a 5 year lease, and preserving the current rent. This equates to a 10% reduction, but front loads us with the cash to improve the space to make it more viable in the long term. I remain in two minds about this - ideally given more energy and time, I think we should be trying to find a larger space for less dosh with better access to public transport, possibly more central. With the current downturn in the economy and the govt making noises about supporting innovation, and our previously approved Lottery West status, I'm almost sure there is a one-or-two year path that would set us up with a semi-peppercorn lease on a govt or council building, or possibly even owning something outright. So, if Don & George come back with a "Denied", I suggest we take that as a possibly good thing - let's negotiate a 1 year continuation or better a 6month notice period with rolling terms, and commence the hunt for a permanent home, ASSUMING that people-not-me think that they have the energy to do so. It's definitely easier to just accept the current place than face a huge move. If Don accepts (and no doubt will be very grumpy about it, given the flexibility he's shown to us when our finances were a bit off in past years), please look around at each other, take a deep breath and say - are we really wanting to commit to a long lease at the current place? I don't think it would be an issue to break off or sublease if something stunning and peppercorny came up.

### Officer Reports

#### Chairperson's Report

-   Apologies for my increasing absence, both physically and online. Work is drawing me away big time, and for the next 18 months at least I'm going to have greatly reduced sustainable Artifactory involvment. I am handing over Events to Stuart - thanks Stu for volunteering, if someone else can step up and take that on as Stu is already heavily loaded as Treasurer, that would be fabulous.
-   AGM - planning for this needs to start soon. I will not be continuing as a committee member, apologies. (see bullet point one). Pre-AGM / next meeting - there is a chance I will be departing in early August, and will be seeing my folks the July 31 weekend in Busselton before I head off, so again unreliable Chairman.
-   laser cutters & NM equipment cash - I feel we need to do a little juggling of accounts. SwanCon & NM patrons have handed over cash to support the purchase of the new sound system, and we need to honour that. So I suggest that Artifactory purchases the amplifiers I got with the cash we have accumulated for that purpose, but if funds are needed for laser tube, I can float some (all?) of the cash back immediately. I am happy "owning" the new digital mixer for a longer period (ie, not invoicing. price \~\$1200). This means we can look swanCon and NM patrons in the eye and say their cash was used for the purpose they thought it was going to.
-   general: more cleaning, more reduction of visual clutter & wiring mess! Use those vacuums! :)
