discussion:

1.  SH said some information was wrong. Is there other basis?
2.  TG But we were still made to look bad
3.  SMM suggested it was not only Mitch's communication that was problematic.
4.  LEM as it was based on faulty information, it should not stand. As a result of that, now we are aware of the faulty information it should not stand
5.  SMM, Hugh, RC suport LEM
6.  Nick It was not ALL incorrect, can the rest of the information substantiate the warning?
7.  TG we need to let it stand or reject it.
8.  SH if we don't pass this motion, we should rescind the warning
9.  TG if there are further concerns, bring them to the committee.

Moved SH that the motion about Mitch not representing the space stand.

1.  Seconded Nick
2.  Nick support based on the fact that it was not one thing.
3.  TG the issue with communication with Adam and Cynthia was not the only issue.
4.  SH raises other issues about when Mitch knew the tube was ready to pick up
5.  TG clear documentation required then we go ahead.
6.  SH should it stand until we gather more information or rescind and raise again
7.  TG we should rescind and address it at another meeting if there is sufficient reason.
8.  LEM because it was based on false information that it should not stand
9.  rejected. 1 for, 5 against SH abstained

SH moves that we rescind  
seconded LEM  

1.  SH even though I abstained, the discussion was that we recind so I support it.
2.  Nick agrees necessary and logically consistent

passed without dissent

Mitch's complaint items still outstanding (from Mitch's email) \#7 (only)

1.  LEM - we can't consult you or it would be favouritism
2.  TG - Agrees

4.  LEM - happy to apologise, for stress and anguish, but not on what we did on good faith.
5.  Nick - you have the right of reply
6.  SH - publicly announced in minutes. announce other stuff in minutes
7.  TG - also edit the group post to announce it is rescinded.
8.  TG & SH - also note that the previous minutes are changed.
9.  TG disagrees wth deletion from mailing list (has issues with deletion)
10. SH, LEM, SMM think its a good idea.
11. LEM now disagrees :-)

Moved Nick that we

1.  post the minutes from 12/10 as amended with explanatory text describing what and why we changed
2.  annotate the existing google group post with a header saying they're deprecated, describing the items changed, and inline descriptions of changes
3.  post these minutes as draft

seconded SH  
Mitch was invited to comment -- he says that's fine  
LEM, SMM we should do it  
passed without dissent

broad discussion was had on items 4 and 6 and these or others will me raised at a future committee meeting if anyone considers it appropriate.

They should be agenda items before the meeting
