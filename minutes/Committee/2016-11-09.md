### Chairman's report

It's been about 1/2 a month since the meeting and we're still here.

### Treasurer's Report

Funds are down \$800 on last month. Partially due to expenses for Acrylic/LED strips \~\$771 timing on revenue from those, loss of members to end of last month plus going from no stock to lots in the month for the fridge/kitchenette. I do not think it is a matter of concern that the overall balance was down. I still recommend not spending unless it will revenue generating or for tool maintenance.

Request New Uniform Fee Signs need to made at Lasers/Swarf-o-mat/Welding/3D Printer(ready for when it is working) as per pricing on website. Unfortunately I'm exceedingly time poor so if anyone wants to do it that would be great.

3.  2 burgay ct. sth of scarb bch rd. 460m wh 360m2 office 250m'2 yard. going to have a closer look
4.  roberts st - we love it but we're not interested -- no outdoor space.

spoke to one of the local councellors. Stirling doesnt have property that we could use. residential not commercial. he will talk to city of stirling and maybe state govt.

### Subcommittee

      - Membership (See [[subcommittee:start]])
      - Change of rules (Steve will not move that the quorum for a subcommittee be capped if we have a subcommittee which includes more than 6 members.  The infrastructure subcommittee has the potential to have many members.  If we have not limited it's membership to a core group and structured it as per the recommendations in the proposed terms of reference (or if any other subcommittee gets too big) our rules will make it difficult for the subcommittee to function.  At present I feel the quorum for a subcommittee should be 3 members at most.)

move SH 2nd NB that the membership of the fundraising subc be accepted. passed without dissent

move SH 2nd RC that NB & Jim M be the new members of the laser sub committee. passed without dissent
