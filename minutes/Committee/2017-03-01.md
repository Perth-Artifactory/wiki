### SGM date and time, confirmation

The SGM was announced a few days ago for 15 Mar 2017. This was informally approved at an unminuted meeting where a quorum of the management committee were present. It was noted that the constitution does not require the SGM to be formally called before it is announced. We thus need to minute that the management committee agree to an SGM.

MOVED (SH) That an SGM is held at 7pm on the evening of 15 Mar 2017 at 2 Burgay Court for the primary purpose of polling the membership about the acceptance of the lease and subsequent move to 2 Burgay Court.

SECONDED (LEM)
