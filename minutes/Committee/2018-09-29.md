-   No full month has past since 01/09 meeting, so last months [figures can be found here](http://wiki.artifactory.org.au/doku.php?id=committee:committee_meeting_2018.09.01)
-   Recommendation don't spend any money unless
    1.  it is for finishing off the Z-Lab
    2.  getting 'kellog' up and running
    3.  needed for laser maintenance
-   To the new Committee members
    -   All cash must be banked. If you need to be reimbursed for buying some drinks, choc.s, or some other approved expense etc. You must send a electronic copy of the receipt(photos are ok) to treasurer AT artifactory.org.au plus your bank details.
-   NeverNever
    -   What is it? The NeverNever is a record of expenses by some members for things bought for the Artifactory but never ever ever expected to get reimbursed nor is entitled to. In January 2016 the Treasurer has committee approval to reduce Never-Never balances in exchange for membership given that the bank account has a healthy balance.
    -   Member Peter Hillier 18/9/18 has authorised the use of his NeverNever balance to sponsor member in the future of the committee's choosing. \$263.31.
    -   I've added lots of things to this agenda below, if things can't be resolved at this meeting hold them over for further discussion but please list the points of difference and who is interest in getting them resolved.
-   Mel
    -   Mel reviewed finances with Stuart
