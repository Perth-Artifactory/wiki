Anything smaller should be stored in locker. \* 4) The committee may audit the contents of the trolley at any time. \* 5) Anything on the trolleys that falls outside these specifications or has a date more than 6 moths old at the time of an audit becomes the property of the Artifactory.

Lemming to post rules to list via TidyHQ on rules and google list.

Proposed Motion: Adopt the Member Rack restrictions as written. \* Steve move \* Fletcher second \* Vote passed

#### Policy Review

The plan is to replace the Tidyspace policy with the following. "Area hosts" and the tag system have been removed.

Areas:

This is always subject to change, as the space evolves and mutates the list of areas will change.

-   CNC Room: The back part of the toolroom, this is the area where the Artifactory keeps all of the robotic mechanical cutting tools, currently home to the Swarf-O-Mat CNC Router and MïllDřéd.
-   Heavy Tool Room: The front part of the toolroom, this is where we keep the manual machine tools and handheld power tools.
-   Laser Area: Where the Laser Cutters and tool wall lives
-   Stage: The stage is at the front of the space and houses the Artifactory collection of A/V gear and interesting lighting. Also houses the space sound system.
-   Electronics Bench: The electronics area has a bunch of work bays for hacking on most anything that facilitates the flow of electrons including Soldering Stations, Oscilloscopes and lab power supplies.
-   CAD Room: The CAD room houses design workstations as well as our 3D printer and vinyl cutter.
-   Member Storage Racks: The area in front of the band room for material sheet storage
-   Social Area: The area with the couches. Try to be more social.
-   Bar/Kitchen: The bar and the kitchen. Includes a full coffee machine, dishwasher, fridges, and washing machine.
-   Car Park: The front bit outside, where the large bin is and where cars should go.
-   Rear Courtyard: The rear bit outside, larger projects and spraying is permitted
-   Welding Area: Next to the front roller door, but also includes the area directly inside the roller door.
-   General Space: The big open bit in the middle of the space not covered by any of the previous areas.

Leaving projects in the space:

-   The Artifactory does not guarantee the safety of any personal projects.
-   Projects may be left in the space for a few days so long as:
    -   The project is on a single trestle table
    -   The trestle table can be moved by two members without disturbing your project
    -   A sign is left on the table that includes your name, contact details, and date of pickup
    -   Your project will not be left in the space during events that require either the entire project area/general area or all of the trestle tables. It is your responsibility to check the calendar and confirm.
-   While we will attempt to contact you if any of these conditions are not met there is risk that your project may be disposed of or end up on the hack-me bench.
-   Anything that would violate the requirements set out above must be done in coordination with the Management Committee.

Skip/Rubbish collection:

-   When the skip bin is full, any member can call Instant Waste Management: 08 9379 2111
-   Their office is open 0700-1700 Mon-Fri, 0700-1200 Sat
-   Say you're from the 'Perth Artifactory'. They'll probably ask if it is a "skip is front loading with a lid" - Say "YES" and they may confirm address. 8 / 16 Guthrie St, Osborne Park.
-   Place the sign "LEAVE GATE OPEN FOR SKIP EMPTY" on gate, which lives in the Artifactory foyer.
-   Leave carpark gate wide open for the truck
-   We are charged approximately \$60 an empty in 2018
-   Bulk metal is heavy and valuable - expensive in the skip, potentially profitable (or at least picked up for free) outside it.

\<del\> \* Post to the mailing list to make sure the gate stays that way and put up the skip sign (left next to the front door)\</del\>

Proposed Motion: Replace the Tidyspace policy with the new space policy as written. \* Proposed: Fletcher \* Second: Iain \* Vote: approved

#### Door Timer

Discussion around usage of door timer. The clock-like thing near front door to indicate when space is open.

Work in progress!

#### Front door key distribution

Fletcher: While the long term plan is to issue door keys to all committee members we should accelerate that for Mel and Scott since they're the closest to the space. Maybe me as well since if something goes wrong with doorbot I'll probably be the closest to fix it.

<s>Proposed motion: Mel/Scott/Fletcher to be issued with physical front door keys. Organiser to be reimbursed \$X</s> Irrelevant due to new door installed

STU: (if done by Saturday's meeting) Front door handle hardware has been replaced. Replacement Keys issued to Committee members who want it and recorded in TidyHQ as per by-laws.

#### Coles/Woolworths account

Fletcher: Both Coles and Woolies offer business accounts with delivery for bar/kitchen stocking. If we go with Coles we'd need to set up a debit card with a low limit for billing whereas woolies offer credit to accounts with our spending habits. (We're below the requirements for Coles credit). Either of these accounts would provide the following benefits: \* Multiple people can add things to an order as required \* Generates proper receipts that aren't printed on thermal paper \* Would allow us to more accurately track what's being purchased for the bar and identify popular products etc \* Less work for quartermasters

STUART: Yes if it doesn't requires us to have a credit account and we can use our personal credit card

Proposed motions: Authorise Fletcher/Stuart to create a Coles business account that does not require credit facilities and personal credit cards can be used for purchases that will be reimbursed as currently authorised by the rules.

| Status      | Accepted/Rejected |

#### Policy compliance

Followup discussion regarding several instances where policies and by-laws weren't or nearly weren't followed

Raised by Mel:

-   Lots of by-laws added
-   A reminder to follow the rules we have spent time to put in place. Lead by example.
-   Request to check your committee email once per day
-   Blake - Check what constitution says on email votes

#### Shirt purchase

Fletcher: The giant robot shirts in the office currently belong to Stuart. They should be purchased by the Artifactory for sale. (STU "Thank you for adding to the agenda - I keep forgetting to put it on for like 4/5 months now")

STU: Shirts cost \$20.24 x 3. Sell via TidyHQ for \$25

#### G Suite transition

Committee members will have received setup instructions for their Artifactory Google account.

-   Stuart - Email routing questions - to Fletcher to fix
-   Transition has happened. We have accounts.
-   Still email routing issues to be sorted

#### New By-Law

\*\* Money Donations \*\*

1.  Any money received by the Artifactory as a donation must go into the "Perth Artifactory - Donations" account.
2.  Types of money donations maybe "General Donations", "Sponsoring a Member Donation", "Event/Workshop Support Donation", "Specified Equipment/Venue enhancements"
3.  If the donor wishes to be remain anonymous, it shall be recorded in TidyHQ and the Secretary informed.

General Donations (not specified)

-   Shall only be used for the Equipment/Venue Enhancements or held until direction for use is given by the Committee. (This allows the Treasurer to draw funds from general donations for equipment and venue enhancements as approved as by the Committee.)

Donations for Specified Equipment/Venue Enhancement

-   Shall be used for the purpose of the Specified Equipment/Venue enhancements.
-   If the Committee is satisfied that cause of the donation has completed the purpose, leftover monies can be treated as a general donation.

Member Sponsorship Donations

-   Funds can only be used to Sponsor Associate Memberships if the Membership Classification allows it.
-   The process as to who receives the sponsored membership is through a committee selected member panel who will choose sponsored members from a publicly advertised process on the Artifactory website.
-   If any panel member has a close connection to an individual applying, they must excuse themselves from the selection panel.
-   The Artifactory Committee as part of the constitution still has to accept the nominated Associate Membership like any membership.

Donations to support a particular event or workshop.

-   Shall be used for the purpose of supporting the event/workshop
-   Cannot be treated as a donation if an individual or group that runs the event/workshop benefits financially from the event/workshop.
-   If the Committee is satisfied that cause of the donation has completed the purpose, leftover monies can be treated as a general donation

##### Proposal for Website - Application Process

Thanks to generous donors the Perth Artifactory Inc is able to offer the opportunity to (propose 6) tertiary students a free 3 month Sponsored Student Membership at the Artifactory. Members of the Artifactory will support the chosen applicants in areas of their interests.

This application is open to tertiary students who are interested in design, artistic creativity, cosplay engineering, music, electronics and who just want to make stuff.

Interested applicants are to submit a 1 page proposal, addressing the following points:

-   What opportunities does the Perth Artifactory offer you?
