## Other Business

Note: "Other Business" must be listed in agenda (top of this page) 48 hours prior to meeting. Any details of an agenda item can be added here at any time.

### By-Law modification: Tool Usage fees

Proposed motion: Modify the CNC Machine section of Tool Usage Fees By-Law last defined at the 01/09/2018 meeting of the Management Committee to read:

| Moved By    | Fletcher |
|-------------|----------|
| Seconded By | Stuart   |
| Status      | Approved |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

CNC Machines:

\* Member Rate: \$0.10 per minute rounded up to the nearest dollar if using **Artifactory tooling**. \* Member Rate: \$0.05 per minute rounded up to the nearest dollar if using **your own tooling**. \* Casual User Rate: \$5 per 10 minutes rounded up to the nearest \$5.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rationale: There are two things that influence tool usage costs. The direct material cost to the space (filament, power, lens etc) and the space the machine takes up. A drop in price for those using their own tooling reflects the cost members are taking on themselves by bringing their own bits. The machine room cleanup has also drastically reduced the amount of space used by Swarf-o-mat.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### By-Law modification: RFID Keys for Members

| Moved By    | Stuart   |
|-------------|----------|
| Seconded By | Fletcher |
| Status      | Approved |

Rationale: New point in **bold.** Due to two bit circus experience back in November.

-   RFID keys are provided to members based on their membership classification.
-   RFID issued needed to be recorded in TidyHQ and with Doorbot
-   Should a person move from one classification to another. The Key bond that they are required to hold can be based on one of the previous classifications that they have held or based on a previous membership fee amount
-   Members RFID Keys can be disabled by **the management** committee.
-   Prior 01/09/2018 - for some reason or another in the past. It is noted that for some long standing members do not have a key bond.
-   **The Chair, Treasurer and any two other committee members reserve the right to waive the bond if it is considered beneficial to the Artifactory to do so. The decision must be documented at the next regular committee meeting**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### By-Law modification: Events and Workshops

| Moved By    | Fletcher |
|-------------|----------|
| Seconded By | Blake    |
| Status      | Approved |

Rationale: New point in **bold.** Adds flexibility if there was some really good event/workshop at short notice.

-   Any committee member may authorise a new workshop or event if
    1.  it will bring in the casual User minimum rate per attendee (excluding members)
    2.  does not require exclusive access of the Artifactory
    3.  does not conflict with another event/workshop unless the Event Coordinators of the other Workshop sees no conflict
    4.  will not conflict with persons using noisy tools
    5.  will not hinder a band using the Rehearsal room.
    6.  must be added to the google calendar
-   **The Chair and any three other committee members reserve the right to waive the above rules if it is considered beneficial to the Artifactory to do so. The decision must be documented at the next regular committee meeting**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### By-Law addition: Conducting business via email

Proposed motion: Add a By-Law titled "Conducting Business via Email" that reads as follows:

Retracted - discussed but not voted on.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Management Committee may consider and motion on any ordinary business via email provided that the following special considerations for quorum are met.

-   If a motion is called via email the quorum (and thus threshold for majority calculations) will be every member of the Management Committee for the first 49 hours of the vote.
-   If the motion has not passed or been rejected by this time then the committee members that have already participated in the motion will be considered as quorum provided that their number is greater than the quorum requirement set out in Guidance Note D of the Constitution.

Any communication falling under this clause must be minuted at the next ordinary meeting of the Management Committee.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rationale: It is currently unclear how committee votes should be handled between scheduled meetings. This uncertainty has hamstrung the effective operation of the Management Committee.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

AGAINST THIS MOTION - Stuart

The constitution under sections [42-48 - committee_meetings](/constitution#committee_meetings) is sufficient for dealing with decisions at short notice.

Rationale:

    -Section 42.3 allows meetings at short notice - 48 hours
    -Face to Face meetings are better for discussion and section 45 allows for use of Technology for persons to attend.
    -To conduct business outside of a meeting is probably against the constitution.
    -It would better to add flexibility to the by-laws so decisions can be delegated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### By-Law modification: Artifactory Expenses

Proposed motion: Modify the Artifactory Expenses By-Law last defined at the 01/09/2018 meeting of the Management Committee to read:

| Moved By    | Fletcher |
|-------------|----------|
| Seconded By | Stuart   |
| Status      | Approved |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Committee allows the Treasurer to pay/reimburse for the following expenses without needing to seek committee approval. **The Treasurer may defer reimbursement until a meeting of the Management Committee at their discretion.**

-   Lease and variable outgoings, building bonds
-   Fund Raising Fridge/Kitchenette Supplies (sell-able items)
-   Consumables for cleaning the Artifactory + toiletry supplies
-   **Materials and consumables for use by a subcommittee of the organisation provided that the total amount is less than \$75 and the expense has been approved by the head of the relevant subcommittee.**
-   Internet, welding gas, rubbish disposal, bank fees, merchant fees, fees associated with maintaining the membership database/management, electricity

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rationale: Some members that have time to do things around the space have that time because they're unemployed/retired and therefore do not have a lot of liquid cash that can be tied up in the reimbursement process. Waiting for a full vote of the committee for inconsequential purchases places undue financial burden on those members.

Note: additions have been marked **in bold**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### By-Law addition : Duties Delegated by the Secretary

Proposed motion: New By-Law to read:

| Moved By    | Stuart   |
|-------------|----------|
| Seconded By | Fletcher |
| Status      | Approved |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The [Office bearers](constitution#committee_members), Deputy Treasurer, Deputy Secretary [Membership Officer](/committee/committeerulings#membership_officer_s) and the associations Bank Signatory's are authorised to accept written notices of resignation under the constitution item [10](/constitution#resignation) resignation

The Treasurer, Deputy Treasurer, Deputy Secretary and the associations Bank Signatory's are authorised to assist the Secretary with the maintaining of the register of members under the constitution item [13.1, 13.2](/constitution#register_of_members) and [30.d](/constitution#secretary)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### By-Law modification: Resident Artist Modification

Proposed motion: Modify the last defined at the 01/09/2018 meeting of the Management Committee to read:

| Moved By    | Fletcher |
|-------------|----------|
| Seconded By | Hugh     |
| Status      | Approved |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Description: Noizemaschin Residency - Every 3 months the Artifactory allows a Noizemaschin panel-selected Audio Artist 3 months membership, with guaranteed NM performances slots. The Artist is to build wacky things or engage with the Artifactory in some way, and demonstrate their inventions at NoizeMachin!!

-   While the Noizemaschin Panel selects the Artist, the Artist must be formally approved by the Committee
-   The Artist is expected to play at 3 Noizemaschin events (where possible)

    -   **3 rehearsal slots/month;**
    -   **Extra bookings may be made if a slot is free, no earlier than 48 hours in advance of the time you are booking**

-   The membership lasts for a period of 3 month**s**.
-   A person can only hold this membership once.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Felicity

Felicity has formally resigned to move over east. Our quorum requirements remain unchanged because they're a fixed number (4) rather than a percentage.

Relevant sections of the Constitution (slightly compressed for clarity):

-   [39.1](https://wiki.artifactory.org.au/doku.php?id=constitution#filling_casual_vacancies) "The committee may appoint a member who is eligible under rule 28.3 to fill a position on the committee..."
-   [28.3](https://wiki.artifactory.org.au/doku.php?id=constitution#committee_members) "A person may be a committee member if the person is an individual who has reached 18 years of age; and an ordinary member."

Voted to add adding Lauren to agenda.

Discussed her being added to committee.

Proposed: Fletcher Seconded: Lemming Status: Approve
