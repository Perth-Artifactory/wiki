### Insurance

(Stuart) Paid prior to 4pm 31st deadline. Cost up about \$60 on last year.

They have no issues with events run by external people.

### Notice Board to Sell/Exchange stuff

(Member Teresa) Proposal *- notice board in which members can share items they have for sale to sell to each other The rules would be as follows:*

1.  *Notices older than 1 month old get cleared off at end of open day*
2.  *Must have a name, phone number, email and date posted*
3.  *Must be a current member of The Artifactory to be able to post on it*

*Perhaps near or on the wall where all the pictures are.*

| Status      | Accepted |

Discussed but went with above instead: (Stuart thought bubbles) - Or do we have a community notice board. Or Post it wall. IE MDF all of the outside of the Office and Stick posters on it.

### International Beer Shop

*(Member Regan) Just had a chat to the boss man and he is happy to offer all the Artifactory members a 10% discount on all products in store excluding the Liquor Baron weekly promotions as they are already discounted.*

*As for the Artifactory supplies we will set up a pay on the day account that will give you the staff discount pricing on all the products you buy (except Back Pallet deals). The account can be set up to allow yourself*(Stuart)// and Fletcher to use when buying beers for the Artifactory.//

*Not much is required on your end, except for informing your members of the discount at the International Beer Shop in Leederville.*

*We will create an Artifactory member discount where they come into the shop, say they are an Artifactory Member, that the password is to be advised and they will receive a 10% discount.*

Accept the International Beer Shops Offer - Add to the Wiki Shops page + post to google group.\*\* Who will do this \*\*

### By-law modification: Casual Makers

(IAIN) Clarification/Modification to existing casual rate by laws; Three Modifications to the current \$10 requirement to use the space.

1.  For visitors: Outside of paid events it's free to simply visit and hang out in the social area. This includes the use of the power board in the middle of the casual area if visitors would like to be on a laptop or charge their phone.

| Moved By    | Mel      |
|-------------|----------|
| Seconded By | Fletcher |
| Status      | Accepted |

Discussed but decided against these:

1.  For events only using the project space (ie: no stage gear): Lower the minimum price of events to \$5. Events like VR/Boardgames/Artifrag are a hard sell at \$10 entry. Decreasing the cost lets smaller events appeal to a wider audience, and the price can always be increased later.
2.  Maintain the casual day rate at \$10: Using the space or tools as a casual user incurs a \$10 day rate as it always has.

### Cheaper Event Fees

-   Board games - \$5
-   VR - \$5

### Review Public Building / Planning Approval from 2015/2014

(Stuart) - Important to review

From Nov 2014 - To be a Public Building

1.  **Committee to note** The single designated exit door and the toilet facilities limit the maximum occupancy allowed to 50 persons. As discussed, the number of people expected at performances or events at the Artifactory are expected to exceed 50 persons. In such instances it would be necessary to provide an additional toilet/s and to ensure that the roller door is kept open during the course of the event or performance. These two conditions will be specified on the certificate.
2.  **Need to do again** Please make arrangements to have the fire equipment serviced and ensure that the equipment displays service history tags. Fire equipment should be checked every six months in accordance with Australian Standard AS 1851.
3.  **They are still there** NO ESCAPE signs are required above the door and roller door at the rear of the premises.
4.  **Need to check** Ensure that the exit sign and no escape signs are illuminated. Please note that emergency lighting/exit signs must be operationally checked every six months and the related works are to be recorded in a log book.
5.  The electrical contractor engaged to carry out the electrical work is required to complete the attached form 5. Please return the completed form to the City viastirling@stirling.wa.gov.au
6.  **Need to check**Ensure that exit pathways are kept unobstructed.
7.  **Need to check** Take necessary precautions to ensure that the carpets laid on the floor do not create a trip hazard.
8.  A sample of the stage curtain was flame tested. The material burned readily and therefore does not comply with regulatory requirements. Please ensure that the curtains are removed permanently, treated with a flame retardant or replaced with flame retardant curtains.
9.  **Need to check do** Ensure that the spray paint bottles/containers currently stored on shelves are placed in a suitable cupboard or cabinet.

-   **From the Plan Approval 180214 - From CoS minutes - Copy Stored on the GDrive with Certificates**
-   The proposed development to provide and maintain on site at all times, one (1) bicycle bay. **we need a labelled bike bay**

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
    *No goods or materials being stored, either temporarily or permanently, in the car parking or landscaped areas or within access driveways. All goods and materials are to be stored within the buildings or storage yards, where provided;  **do we need to get rid of stuff out front**
    *The Artifactory is intended to operate during evenings and weekends, outside general business hours (nine o’clock to five o’clock Monday to Saturday) when staff and customers are generally absent from the surrounding area. Therefore the Perth Artifactory is expected to improve passive surveillance and contribute towards community safety within the locality.  **Workshop Wednesday needs to be kept small**
    * The Public Buildings Certificate required  **obtained 05/11/2015**
