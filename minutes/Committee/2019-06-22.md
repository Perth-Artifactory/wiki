## Other Business

### Recycling

Should we consider through Instant waste a 660lt co mingle recycling bin (2.75 wheelie bin)

-   \$25 +gst an empty on a monthly pick up.
-   \$50 + gst delivery fee (once off ) for the bin.

A reason for not doing this is [the WA container deposit scheme to commence in early 2020](https://www.der.wa.gov.au/our-work/programs/111-wa-container-deposit-scheme) and not much details is known yet as to how it will operate.

No, committee does not want to do this recycling scheme for financial reasons.

Mel brings up point of aluminium can recycling

-   Dale - he offered to collect and pay us for aluminium cans
-   Can crusher could make that work well - engaging for members

### Social Media Guidelines

The Perth Artifactory uses social media to:

-   Raise awareness of the Artifactory brand, offerings and events,
-   Inspire creativity, stimulate curiosity, empower others to make stuff,
-   Promote an inclusive makerspace environment and encourage people to join the community.

Our online presence can be used to help spread awareness and extend our reach. Posts to social media should support the objectives of the organisation with consideration to how these messages will be received by the community and its impact on the Artifactory sustainable social licence to operate.

The Perth Artifactory and social media accounts are run by volunteers who give their time to support the space. Social media guidelines are not intended to make posting more difficult, but as a layer of protection to identify any risks and resolve them before posting, and to know when to seek approval from the Committee. The list below, while not comprehensive, is intended as a checklist to consider the potential impacts before posting to social media. If a post raises any concerns from the list, the poster should contact a committee member, to review the content and get approval before posting.

**Safety**: Could anyone hurt themselves doing this? Is there a disclaimer to warn of risks? (i.e. Do not try this at home). Is everyone following correct safety procedures? (e.g. using appropriate PPE, observing fire hazards etc.).

**Intellectual Property**: Who has rights over this? Who owns or contributed? Is it a fair representation of work, credit given to creator(s). Has an applicable copyright been invoked? Is any artwork being modified or destroyed? Has the creator consented to modifications?

**Individuals and Groups**: Does the post refer to anyone (by name or implied), or a group, demographic or identity? Has the individual or group given consent, or would they feel comfortable being associated with the Artifactory?

**Photography and Video**: Permission of subjects to release, including parent or legal guardian for minors.

**General**: Would you be happy if this post went viral (received a lot of attention)? Does this represent the objectives of the Artifactory? If you were contacted to investigate the post, would you be happy to answer questions about it?

*That the committee adopt the above social media policy and that the policy be record in the same section of the wiki and By-laws/membership Classifications*

| Moved By    | Stu      |

| Seconded By | Fletcher |
| Status      | Accepted |

Bylaw: To consider for next meeting - Members who have control of social media must be aware of the social media policy.

### Temporary Project Storage - Do we need a dedicated area for this?

Is the below enough?

*Currently it is written in the wiki new members guide -* You can set up a project that requires a small fixed construction area for a reasonable period of time, but be prepared to move it. Label your construction with your name and contact details, especially if it's dangerous (high voltage, batteries, caustic or acidic chemicals, etc)

AND

**Leaving a Project - from Nov18**

-   The Artifactory does not guarantee the safety of any personal projects.
-   Projects may be left in the space for a few days so long as:
    -   The project is on a single trestle table
    -   The trestle table can be moved by two members without disturbing your project
    -   A sign is left on the table that includes your name, contact details, and date of pickup
    -   Your project will not be left in the space during events that require either the entire project area/general area or all of the trestle tables. It is your responsibility to check the calendar and confirm.
-   While we will attempt to contact you if any of these conditions are not met there is risk that your project may be disposed of or end up on the hack-me bench.
-   Anything that would violate the requirements set out above must be done in coordination with the Management Committee.

Discussion

-   Stuart - Do we need a place people can store projects?
-   On mobile table?
-   Stuart - Pallet rack? White acrylic where you claim an area for 1 week?
-   Fletcher - as we rearrange space maybe there an area opens up
-   Stuff on tressels give incentive to clean up lest someone moves it for you
