### Rockets for Kent Street SHS

(added by Melanie 23/07 9:36pm)

Approval needed for wood purchase and laser time to produce 40 rockets. Will sell to Kent St SHS for \$200

Committee is happy with this. Estimated \$30 for materials - approve materials next time.

### Lisa's dice boxes as Supanova

(added by Melanie 23/07 9:36pm)

Lisa sold 23 small boxes for \$25 each, and 3 large boxes at \$45 each for a total of \$710 during the Supanova weekend. The production has cost nothing to the Artifactory, Lisa has purchased the wood, varnish, felt needed for production with the own fund and has paid the Artifactory for the laser time too. Lisa would like to donate 50% of the sale to the Artifactory (\$360) and retain \#350 for herself. As the Artifactory collected all the fund, can we approve for her to be paid back.

### 3D Printers

-   Failure of mainboard - plugged in to wrong power supply
-   Estimate \$50 to repair
-   Iain driving the fix - replacement of RAMPs board

3.  Approved

    -   Head is the main problem
    -   Head could be replaced - has been previously replaced

    -   \$250
    -   1.75mm filament - PLA/HEPS
