We will not be able to implement these workshops before Game 8 in October. SWinc is still keen to access this funding, and will still apply, but the workshops will be run early 2020 before Game 9."

## Other Business

Other business (items not covered by regular meeting sections) may be added to this section up to 48 hours before start of committee meeting.

### NeverNever - By-law

(STU) Currently is stated in the wiki for the NeverNever //as a record of approved items for the Artifactory that have purchased by members for things bought for the Artifactory but never ever ever likely to get repaid nor is entitled to.

As of January 2016 the Treasurer has committee approval to reduce Never-Never balances in exchange for membership given the bank account has a healthy balance.//

Thus it is not defined very well in the top paragraph.

**Proposed By-Law NeverNever**

1/ That the Artifactory acknowledges the NeverNever as unallocated membership paid in-advance and is non-refundable.

2/ The Treasurer has Committee approval to reduce NeverNever balances in exchange for membership when the bank account has a healthy balance and the owner of the NeverNever gives consent.

3/ That the NeverNever cannot be added to, except at a Committee Meeting.

### Band Membership Classification Modification

(STU) Given the number of new bands is back to where it has peaked in the past. (And 6 bands has always be seen as the ideal number.) That the committee limit Band Memberships to 6 until a consultative review has been completed. (Started with Tanner/Stu/Jean-Michel/Fletcher 21/08). After the review we may wish to add an additional membership like a cheaper Monday to Friday business hours only one or something... Until then we should limit the membership with rules rather than not approving additional memberships at a committee meeting........... which I can see as a potential problem if keys etc has already been handed out.

Limiting the number of membership is allowed under the rules. *Constitution rule 8.5 - The Committee may limit the number of members of any class of membership and associate membership.*

**Addition Line for Classification for Band Membership**

<u>The Band Membership is restricted to a maximum of 6 memberships.</u>
