2.  The electrical meter and switchboard needs to be secure from the public. (ie locked)
3.  Ensure the female toilets have hand drying facilities
4.  Where a passage way does not provide a clear means of egress from a public building the passage shall be marked as "No Escape". Letter height 100mm, Lettering width 12mm wide.

### Event Reporting Forms

Request that committee members use the form after events, as an example to others.

Show current form for review from committee

      - https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdrpL35JPyWVSqmnJb8B55MWlCGP0xdfh2-pbqZUvxnLevH-A/viewform

Benefits to Artifactory:

      -Annual report is bolstered by better data and information.
      -Greater chances of funding, as funders like stats and demonstrated outputs.
      -Committee meetings are improved as event officers can provide more accurate and cohesive summaries. 
      -Help inform budget decisions.
      -Allow for networking of interested members with groups by having greater committee shared understanding.

Example:

      -NoizeMaschin!! #100 event report

Takings \$902 less \$292(Toilets+Stamp Pad) less Estimated COGS \$320 = \~\$290

Highlights:

      -100 proved a significant milestone and so greater effort was made.
      -Significant improvement to stage lighting.
      -Usage of 15 amp power circuit to help with audio noise issues
      -NM100b live on RTRfm! Good networking with Difficult Listening crew
      -Toilets hired to comply with building requirements. 
          -classic hire Morley $275 for *one day
      -Good photos of busy space.

Issues:

      -Noisy signal in left mixer. Possibly due to fused ground cables. Possibly due to faulty headphone jack in performer's laptop.

No motion required.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Desktop Label Printer

Currently, labeling things is rather tedious, especially if you want the labels to stick.

This proposal is to purchase a label printer and a raspbery pi, to allow members to quickly create adhesive labels with their name, date and time, simply by scanning their RFID token. With further modification, it will also be able to print more customized labels, including QR codes and other images, from an internal webpage accessible on a computer or phone.

The printer specified can use red/black/white labels, in addition to the (cheaper) black/white labels. There is also a model that is \$50 cheaper, and can print only black/white.

Further notes were posted to the committee channel, and to [OpenLabelmaker](/projects/OpenLabelmaker) (out of date).

-   Brother QL-800 Desktop Label printer (\$149)
-   Raspberry Pi Zero W (\$21), USB adaptor (\$5.00), micro SD card (\$8.50)
-   RFID reader (\$5.50), Arduino nano (\$3.00)

Authorise Vincent Dalstra to spend \$200 on a Desktop Label Printer & peripherals

### Workspace Usage Policy to be Modified

Two proposals below.

#### Workspace usage policy

This by-law regulates how much space members may use when working within the Artifactory, or when temporarily leaving materials within the space. It does not further restrict the use of member storage, nor any other space specifically allocated to storing materials/projects.

1.  No usage of workspace may conflict with a scheduled event.
2.  While within the space, members can occupy up to 3 tables.
    1.  If a member is using more than one table:
        1.  The tables should be located either in the main project area, or in the yard at the back of the building.
        2.  Tables in the same area must be positioned together.
        3.  Tables must not block access to the pallet racking, stage, tool room, or other walkways.
        4.  Should the demand for tables exceed supply, they must relinquish all but one of their tables.
    2.  If a committee or subcommittee requires the table(s), or requires the table to be moved, the member must relinquish or move the table(s) and its contents.
3.  If a member temporarily leaves the space, they must either take their materials with them, or store them:
    1.  Within the member’s allocated storage area.
    2.  In the appropriate materials rack, subject to the conditions of using that rack.
    3.  On top or beneath tables they were using, subject to the conditions in 2a) plus the following:
        1.  Materials must be clearly labelled with the members full name, contact details, and the current date and time. If the materials are small, numerous, or cannot be labelled, then the table may be labelled instead.
        2.  If using 2-3 tables, they must return within 5 hours. If using only a single table, the limit is 18 hours.
        3.  The table(s) are considered to be movable while the member is absent.
        4.  The member must ensure that it will not conflict with any upcoming events.
        5.  If the demand for tables exceeds supply, the member must relinquish their table(s) before they leave.
4.  Committee members can authorise extensions or exceptions to the above rules.
    1.  The authorising member must note the authorisation on the committee slack channel.
    2.  Authorisation can be revoked.
    3.  Extensions should be for the minimum duration, and not exceed 7 days.
5.  Authorisation may be given that conflicts with an event, but the event is still permitted to move the materials/tables.
    1.  Tidy use of the space will reflect favourably on the member when requesting an extension
6.  These restrictions do not apply while:
    1.  The member is acting on behalf of the Management Committee or its subcommittees in an official capacity.
    2.  The member is working on an officially sanctioned project.
    3.  The person is running an official event.
7.  Violations of this policy may result in any of the following at the discretion of the Management Committee:
    1.  Materials being relocated to a single table.
    2.  Materials being relocated to the Hack rack / Hack me bench / Skip bin.
    3.  Initiation of membership suspension proceedings (repeat / egregious offenders).
    4.  Initiation of membership termination proceedings (repeat / egregious offenders).

Update the workspace usage policy, replacing it with the above.

#### Workspace Usage By-Law Alternative Proposal

Workspace Usage By-Law

-   You may occupy up to 3 trestles worth of space while actively working on a project noting that you may need to move it for a scheduled event.
-   Projects may be left in the space for three days so long as:
-   The project is on a single trestle table(including under) that includes your name, contact details, and date of pickup
-   Your project is left in a movable state as events/workshops may have priority over a specified area/general area resulting in the moving of your project.
-   While we will attempt to contact you if any of these conditions are not met there is risk that your project may be disposed of or end up on the hack-me bench. The Artifactory does not guarantee the safety of any personal projects.
-   Anything that would violate the requirements set out above must be done in coordination with the Management Committee.
-   Committee can vetoe these rules.

Update the workspace usage policy, replacing it with the above, and make it permanent.

### Car Park By-Law Modification

*Car Parking Bays cannot be occupied for ongoing projects (more than a day unless authorised by committee and at a cost determined by the committee)*

To

*Car Parking Bays cannot be occupied for materials, projects and goods as this is a requirement of our Planning Approval with the Council.*

### Office Printers

There are currently 7 office printers in the space (excluding the two in the CAD room): 5 on the CAD room roof, and 2 on a wheeled table. All of these printers are A4 only.

One of them also has a scanner. Said printer also has 50% Magenta and 90% Yellow toner remaining. For reference, replacing the other two with genuine cartridges would cost \~\$500

One of the regular printers has 50% Cyan and 50% Magenta; it also came with 4 cartridges, one of each colour. For reference, they cost \~\$180 new, per cartridge. Aftermarket prices are much cheaper (1/8). This is probably the only one with any real value.

The other printers have not been checked.

Authorise the IT officer to sell or dispose of the specified office printers as they see fit.
