## Other Business

### Administering of Arts Grants “The Reinvention Room” is finished

This is a report to the Committee and no action is required.

-   Background Artifactory acted as Auspicor.(Administrator of the Grant on behalf of Propel Youth Arts) Members Stuart and Jean-Michel managed it.
-   Final report received on the project 01/11/2019.
-   All documents associated with Auspicing are in the Committee GDrive - Treasurer - Auspicing - Reinvention Room.

Pros and Cons of Auspicing a Grant for future reference.

-   It is does require some effort for those Artifactory members that agree to monitor it on behalf of the Artifactory.
-   We did receive a fee 3% of the Grant. In the future maybe at least go double.
-   We ended up with a new permanent member as well as received tool usage fees for lasers, welding and membership fees that allowed for those running the project to be umbrella under our insurance.
-   The Artifactory received promotional exposure

Recommendations for the future

-   Those taking on Auspicing of the Future should be aware that it will be time intensive at times.
-   It would be easier to keep their Insurance coverage separate from ours
-   Don't get involved in grants where the Artifactory would have to pay wages. (Not that that was a thing with this)
-   A separate bank account was opened to administer that Grant. Definitely do that again in the future.

### Tool specific inductions

As the space evolves we've got more and more tools that have a serious risk of injury if used improperly. The Infrastructure subcommittee will usually have a high % of tool skilled members and can adequately identify the more dangerous tools.

By-law addition: Tool inductions

The Infrastructure Subcommittee may gate dangerous tools behind a tool specific induction at their discretion and appoint trainers.

A list of gated tools and appointed trainers must be made available on the wiki and on or near the tools themselves.

### Laser

The laser subcommittee still hasn't bought a tube, should we adjust or rescind our spending motions and/or provide more direction for the subcommittee?

Committee discussion regarding laser tube decisions. Decision made at previous meeting still stands.

Other business (items not covered by regular meeting sections) may be added to this section up to 48 hours before start of committee meeting.
