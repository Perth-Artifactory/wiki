Action Items (if required)

| Action Items                                    | Who       |

### COvid.19

-   We should get big bottles of hand Sanitizer and put them out in the space.
    -   Since our financial situation is fairly good, we can do this.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### New Bylaw - Control of Funds

The Constitution Rule 63.5 States *63.5 All funds of the Association must be deposited into the Association’s account within 10 working days after their receipt unless otherwise approved by the by-laws* <https://wiki.artifactory.org.au/doku.php?id=constitution#control_of_funds>

Due to majority paying by EFTPOS or Bank Transfer or Through TidyHQ. The Artifactory collects little cash compared to the past partially a result of Covid.19. Thus it is proposed that the frequency of Banking be left with the Treasurer to decide and level of float needed to be kept for various events.

**Motion** Proposed motion *The Committee waives the requirement for funds to be deposited within 10 working days as allowed under the Constitution Rule 63.5 and noting some funds need to be held as float for some events and workshops.*

**Motion** Amended Motion *The Committee waives the requirement for funds to be deposited within 10 working days as allowed under the Constitution Rule 63.5 and noting some funds need to be held as float for some events and workshops. This by-law ceases to be of effect on 31 March 2020*

//To take effect from 23/08/2020 //
