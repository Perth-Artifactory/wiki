### Review Previous Meeting's Minutes

-   Inconsistency in previous minutes motion:
    -   Title: "Sponsored memberships"
    -   Body: "Appoint Johannes Chuah as the new rehearsal room coordinator."

I think the latter is correct.

**Motion:** Change the title to read: "Rehearsal Room coordinator".

AND

Accept the previous meeting's minutes, and the meeting before that.
