## Other Business

### Change to Vice Chair position

We should update the current roles and responsibility of Vice Chair.

The Vice Chairman's functions include, but are not limited to - Performing the Chairman's functions when the Chairman is unavailable. Sharing the Chairman's workload Ensuring audit and maintenance logs of the Artifactory, and actioning maintenance or other activities that arise from these. Responsible for organising and maintaining the cleanliness of any premises held by the association. For example by organising clean up events, providing cleaning incentives etc

Motion deferred for a rewrite prior to next meeting; specifically, it should contain the text of a proposed new by-law.

### How the Artifactory interacts with Persons under the age of 18

We need to have a clear outline of how Persons under 18 can use and be in the Artifactory.

Example of what should be added to the Wiki

Children 12 and under - must remain in arms reach of parent or guardian at all times Children 16-13 - must remain in same working area as parent, I.e machine room, project area, backyard, design lab, electronics lab, hot works area Children 17-16 - parent or guardian must accompany to the space. All power tool usage must be supervised by parent or guardian. Any tool use will be chargeable at casual member rate. No one under the age of 18 may accompany any ordinary Artifactory member outside of the Artifactory. Consumption of alcohol is prohibited. Any persons under the age of 18 consuming alcohol will be immediately expelled. Any incident involving a persons under 18 must be reported to the parent or guardian immediately. Special privileges may be awarded to a persons of the age of 17 after frequent attendance to the space for a period no less than 1 year and that they have a provisional driver's licence. These privileges extend to unsupervised use of the project area, design lab and electronics lab. All other areas and associated tool usage must be accompanied by a parent or guardian. The Artifactory is not a daycare. Anyone under the age of 16 may not use slack nor have a slack account (also part of Slack's term's of service).

Deferred to next meeting, to be written-up formally as a new by-law.

| Action Items                                                    | Who      |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| Write up "person's under the age of 18" by-law for next meeting | Fletcher |

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Code of Conduct

We have multiple concurrent draft CoCs on the go (document distributed via Slack). Please review when you have a chance. However, this meeting is not the place to have a constructive discussion about changes compared to an asynchronous discussion online.

Actual discussion point for today:

Splitting workshop safety and general code of conduct up, since they deal with very different types of things.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Remember to set **next meeting time** before closing meeting!
