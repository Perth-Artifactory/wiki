## Other Business

Other business (items not covered by regular meeting sections) may be added to this section up to 48 hours before start of committee meeting.

### Model Rockets Reimbursement

Regarding reimbursement for Model Rocket kits. See Lisa's posts on Slack for more detail.

These meeting's minutes may also be relevant (hyperlink goes to section on rockets).

[2020.07.25](Committee_Meeting_2020.07.25#expenses_for_approval)

[2019.07.27](Committee_Meeting_2019.07.27#rockets_for_kent_street_shs)

**Treasurers comment**

-   She is entitled to the reimbursement; currently busy trying to check if it has already been sent (and missed) or not, before it gets done.
-   No action required.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### RFID Keys for Members By-Law modification: Photos

We're at a membership size where a lot of people don't know each other anymore. While it would be "ideal" to require photos from all members that has a variety of privacy implications that aren't worth approaching right now. A much more reasonable requirement is for us to retain ID photos for members who hold keys.

**Motion**

Add the following bullet point to the RFID Keys for Members By-Law:

-   Members requesting keys after 10/01/2021 must submit a head/shoulders photo suitable for identification purposes. The Secretary or Treasurer may rule that a provided picture does not meet these requirements at their discretion.
