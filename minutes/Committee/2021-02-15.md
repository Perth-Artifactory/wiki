### First-Aid training grant

Related to the AED, we have been given \$300 credit with which we can send people on CPR or full first-aid courses (\$50 and \$160 pp, respectively). This would be good to give to workshop organisers and frequent members that have not completed a first aid course in 3 years.

Fletcher's suggested breakdown: Knock \$60 off the price for five people.

### Banned member altercation

Following his membership application rejection and ban from the space Mathew Cass returned to the workshop on Wednesday January 13th. Fletcher and Amy were present at the time.

Fletcher in \#committee on the 13th:

    Asked to have a chat, told him that unfortunately we'd decided not to continue with his membership. He indicated that he might have stuff still in the space so I offered to let him come in and check. He walked into the machine made a phonecall (to steve I think?) and then came out
    From that point he started acting aggressively and took my photo. On his way out the door he ripped off the top sheet of the COVID sign in sheet because his details were on it. Because it included details of other visitors and members I offered to strike his name from the register but insisted that I would need the sheet back. He grew more aggressive and verbally abusive ("You'll be the first to die" etc) before getting in his car where his shouting continued.
    I retrieved the sign in sheet (with his name scratched out) and returned it to the lobby.

The police indicate that given his past record he is not likely to return to the space.

The following announcement was posted to Slack the next day along with a picture of Mathew.

    It's not often that we reject membership applications and even less often that we have to bar people from the space. However our priority is and always will be the safety of our members and attendees. This notice is being sent out as a precaution only.
    If you see Matthew Cass (license plate <removed>, more car details in the post replies) in the space or parked in the car park please contact one of these two people:
    Fletcher <removed>
    Iain <removed>
    Do not attempt to confront him yourself. If you believe your safety or the safety of others is at risk call 000 immediately.

No motion required
