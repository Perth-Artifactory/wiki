### General financial state

From the start of COVID-19 our financial position has been slipping backwards. We've lost sponsors as businesses have cut back. We've lost members, internal events, and bar sales due to the decrease in community spending. We've also lost once off cash injections from participation at local events (Supanova, Madman etc). The only reason we're still able to move forward with maintenance costs and refurbishments is because these expenditures are being covered by specific members. Without this continued support or injection of funds from other sources we will not survive.

-   Expenses have been covered by private donations.
    -   Hand tool replacements
