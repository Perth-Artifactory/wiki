## Other Business

Other business (items not covered by regular meeting sections) may be added to this section up to 48 hours before start of committee meeting.

### COVID-19 restrictions at the space

Increased COVID-19 transmission rates and changing border restrictions have triggered more serious health mandates. This topic is intended to serve as a consolidated and structured place for this discussion to occur. I have split things up into a serious of sections and included a space to add for/against points for each section. If adding large amounts of text to a section please attach a PDF instead. The intention is that if a particular assertion is accepted by the committee then further discussion against that assertion elsewhere in the meeting can be determined as counterproductive.

### Unsafe actions in the space

The identity of the prospective member has been removed excluded from these minutes. The prospective member also failed to secure the workshop before these events began.

Recap of events:

\* The loaned thicknesserce was reported as damaged by the owner. (Ben D) \* Further investigation by Beau, Fletcher, Jason, and Joshua determined that the damage was caused by improper usage of the thicknesser. (Materials used, depth of cut, and force used while operating the machine) \* Security camera footage attributed the above to the prospective member. \* Discussions with Ben D indicate that the improper use directly contradicted the usage directions he provided. \* Review of the security camera footage also indicated several unsafe working practices. These included excessive force when feeding material into the machine and a dangerous operator position. \* The Infrastructure Subcommittee believes that the combination of the above has a **moderate** chance of leading to **permanent disability**. \* The prospective member's key has been disabled until this meeting.

Possible actions range from re-education to rejection of the membership application, to banned from the space. (Motion text on the day reflecting which option the committee chooses)

**Motion** (if required) Reject the prospective members application to join The Perth Artifactory and limit their usage of the space to only when directly supervised by an experienced Artifactory volunteer.

### Space club auspicing

Adrian K has been asking if we can auspice an event for the Perth Space Club..

They're getting permission to launch a small high-altitude balloon from the Gingin Gravity discovery centre, They will also need to make an application to the Civil Aviation Authority, which requires them to have public liability for the event. This is difficult for them because they are not an incorporated association; therefore, they'd like to make us of ours as a once-off for this event.

Will need to check with our insurer that this can be done.

In regards to the event itself; it's open to Space Club Members (and Artifactory) and friends/family of them; public, but not advertised to uninvolved parties. Entry is not charged. Expecting \~ 20 people; 30 at the most.

**Motion** (if required)

Commit to hosting the event, pending: \* Approval from the insurer \* Review of the event plan by the Perth Artifactory

//To take effect from xx/xx/2020 // (if new bylaw allow time for example for the website/wiki/tidyHQ to be updated.)
