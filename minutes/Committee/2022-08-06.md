------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Rehearsal room equipment status and audit

There is a lot of equipment in the rehearsal room that aren't realistically usable for all bands. Right now there's equipment that's "loaned" to the space but the owner has then removed the item temporarily for for personal use. This has significantly negatively impacted other bands to the point where at least one band has started rehearsing elsewhere.

Our current system of hybrid/loaned backline is worse than either an empty room or a full backline.

Our pricing may also bee too low.

**Motion** (if required)

Move towards Artifactory owned backline

//To take effect from xx/xx/2020 // (if new bylaw allow time for example for the website/wiki/tidyHQ to be updated.)
