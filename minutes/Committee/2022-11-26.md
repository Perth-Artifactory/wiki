Discussed if we should apply now or wait until we have DGR status.

Agreed to wait until we have DGR status.

### Community Shed application

RE our application for deductible gift recipient (DGR) status as a Community Shed.

#### Progress

* Constitution being converted to more capable format (LaTeX) to make it possible to show changes in the document in a user-friendly way.
  * Thanks to #committee-secretariat for all the help with this conversion.
  * https://github.com/Perth-Artifactory/governance

**Three sets of changes will be proposed.**

 1. Community shed amendments
    * Purpose / objects of the association.
    * Open membership.
 2. Minor procedural amendments
    * Don't stop members from voting at AGM/SGM if they have outstanding invoices for pledges/donations.
    * Allow more use of Slack for committee business.
 3. Fixes
    * Renae and Lewis have each done a complete comparison between our constitution and the [Model Rules](https://www.commerce.wa.gov.au/consumer-protection/model-rules). Many typos. Many (unintentional) inconsistencies.

#### Discussion required

* How do we manage 24/7 access / issue of RFID keys.
* How do we put these changes to our members so that they are easy to understand, so the members can make an informed decision to accept / not accept the changes.

* Discussion
  * Key issue to be subject to reasonable procedures in order to meet our duty of care regarding health and safety.

#### Work to be done

* Prepare "exposure draft" of constitution with all proposed amendments and explanations of each.
* Consultation period with members **before** finalising and setting a date for SGM.
* Suggest that the motion raised at the SGM should be simply "to accept the revised constitution with all changes" rather than accepting changes point by point.
* Make clear that the time for members to review the changes is **before** the SGM, not during. The SGM is simply to vote on the motion. Note 75% majority required (not 100%).

### SGM Scheduling

* SGM date can be set using an online motion.
* Probably February.
* Will be driven by workload.

### Swap Secretary / Deputy Secretary

* Phoebe-Jean Harris to change position from Secretary to Deputy Secretary
* Lewis Yip to change position from Deputy Secretary to Secretary
* Constitutionally this procedure is handled under s37 (resignation) and s39 (filling casual vacancies).

#### Motion
