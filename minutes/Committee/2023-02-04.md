Harry C was in today at open day to discuss.

We are assisting with immediate machining needs in the next couple of weeks to assist with meeting a deadline.

Requested to provide sponsored memberships for mentors to do machining / fabrication during the year.

Requested to facilitate some of the students to come through the space under supervision from mentors.

Estimated maximum 10 mentors.

Mentors are all students.

Write off tool usage fees where there is no direct cost to the Artifactory.

Total value of sponsored memberships (10 members for the year) would be about $5,400.

We would get exposure of our logo on the same level as Curtin and Altronics. On shirts, etc.

All legal and compliance aspects of having minors in the space need to be handled by the mentors.

Stipulate that sponsored memberships cannot be used for commercial gain e.g. making stuff for Etsy.

Curtin Robotics is currently sorting out what they want to do for the year.

Curtin Robotics is open to all Curtin students.

Sponsorship terms should include stipulations that sponsored memberships and tool usage fee concessions will only extend to Curtin Robotics Club (CRoC) related usage of the space, not general Curtin usage.
