## Incident Reports

* 2023-05-25 - Band in rehearsal room left front foor of space open while rehearsing, resulting in Renae having to deal with unexpected drop ins.
  * JC communicated with bands via Facebook.

* 2023-06-05 - Renae intervened with member 1 who intended to use one of the laser cutters without having the relevant competency.
  * Member 2 had shown member 1 how to use the laser, however member 2 is not an approved laser trainer.
  * Issue: Deficiency in signage. Nothing on the lasers says that specific training is needed. This also occured with the Mill during a Metal Monday.
    * **ACTION: Apply "You must be Artifactory Trained" signage to laser cutters.**
  * Issue: Deficiency in training of member 2.
    * Fletcher has discussed this with member 2 and reinforced that only approved trainers can deliver laser training.

* 2023-06-11 - Issue with Perth Linux User Group (PLUG) event hosts not in attendance when their event started, resulting in members who happened to be present being required to act as event hosts without prior warning.
  * Timeline:
    * 12:00pm - Scheduled event start time. 2 Artifactory members present allow PLUG attendees into the space.
    * 1:00pm - Artifactory committee member contacts PLUG event host via Slack and enquires as to intentions. No response.
    * 1:40pm - Artifactory committee member escalates to contacting PLUG event host via mobile phone. No response.
    * 2:30pm - PLUG event host arrives. Discussion on arrival is not constructive.
  * Response:
    * The committee's position is that in return for making the Artifactory available as an event space, event hosts take on certain minimum obligations to ensure those events are run competently, including being present to host the event at the designated start time.
    * PLUG has been contacted and asked to respond to this incident. Response expected by 23rd June.

* 2023-06-12 - During a Metal Monday, member 1 offered member 2 a piece of fruit, which member 2 refused. Member 1 then commented on member 2's dietary choices. Member 2 felt very uncomfortable about these comments and reported them to Fletcher.
  * Fletcher and Beau have spoken to Member 1 about this.

## Property Report

* 2023-06-04 - Heavy rain caused flooding in carpark, began to enter the building. Members present turned the sump pump on again, preventing flooding of the space.

* Foyer renovations - foyer has been painted! 🎉
  * Carpet has been removed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Other Business

Other business (items not covered by regular meeting sections) may be added to this section up to 48 hours before start of committee meeting.

### Constitution revision, DGR application

* New constitution [accepted by Commmissioner](/docs/committee/constitution_approval_1830163_a1014456p_2023_06_12_appvd.pdf) 2023-06-12. 🎉🎉
  * [Constitution](/constitution) page on wiki updated.
  * Submitted DGR application to ATO 2023-06-17.
  * Updated constitution on file with ACNC on 2023-06-17 as required by the *Australian Charities and Not-for-profits Commission Act 2012 (Cth)*. Showing as "complete" in the ACNC portal, though new document is not yet showing on the public website.
  * Need to announce new constitution to our membership.

> The below is included for completeness of the record. No action required.

* Commissioner identified an inconsistency between constitution clauses 72.2 and 72.4 relating to disposal of assets in the event the Association is wound up, and recommends that clause 72.4 is inconsistent and should be deleted.
  * Commissioner's opinion is that clause 72.4 is not consistent with the *Associations Incorporation Act 2015 (WA)*.
  * Clause 72.4 contains the ATO's recommended wording for asset disposal which is required to be eligible as a deductible gift recipient.
  * Clause 72.4 says (in short) that assets cannot be distributed to members, and must otherwise be distributed to another not-for-profit in accordance with applicable Australian laws. This is essentially the same as what the *Associations Incorporation Act 2015 (WA)* requires, and the reference to "applicable Australian laws" would already include that Act.
  * Additionally the *Associations Incorporation Act 2015 (WA)* s24 already states that the requirements of s24 already supercede any inconsistent provision in our constitution.
  * **Lewis believes there is no fundamental inconsistency between clauses 72.2 and 72.4 and that  revising this section of our constitution does not mitigate any substantial risk.**

### Laser Training reforms

Trend that free laser training is attracting people into the space who use up hours of volunteer time for laser training. These people generally do not contribute to our community afterwards, resulting in a very poor return on investment.

Discussed in #laser-training and #committee on 2023-05-26.

Points raised include:

* For people who just need one thing cut on the laser (e.g. architecture students), our unwritten policy has been to have a laser operator do the job for them.
  * Cost for this is Day Pass Rate ($15 curently) + laser time rate, with the time including both operator's setup time and actual cutting time.
  * This would seem to meet the needs of all parties.
  * Should we formalise this as a written policy or are there reasons we are avoiding this?
  
* Our volunteers time is valuable and we should charge at least a nominal fee to cover space usage + volunteer time + laser usage.
  * Fletcher has already set up a proof of concept "product" in our TidyHQ store to "buy laser training"
  * Related note: as all laser training competencies are now recorded in TidyHQ, all laser trainees already need to sign up on TidyHQ to enable this.
  * Set fee to a level that encourages member signup as a viable alternative?
  * Laser training fee to be reimbursed if a person signs up as a member within X days (30 days? 7 days?) of being trained?
  * Alternately signing up as a member grants 2x free laser training sessions.
  * JC proposes that laser operation (e.g. machine safety training) and design training (e.g. bitmap tracing, DXF prep) be separate offerings.

* Do we also need to apply "pay for training" to any other tools in the space.
  * Lasers
  * CNC routers (swarf-o-mat)
  * Mill
  * 3D printers
    * What price would we set for this?
    * Do not include 3D modelling in the training.
  
* Multiple (3) people expressed general sentiments that we are (and remain) enthusiastic about helping anyone who shows interest and engages with our community, we need more of those people! The thing we need to mitigate is people who take up our time and never give anything back.


#### Discussion ####
Have people (e.g. Architecture students) who come in to cut only a single job, and aren't actually interested in learning to use it.

* Current unofficial method is that laser trainers cut the job, but charge $15 + full rate for time (including setup, not just machine time).
  *	Takes a lot of volunteer time
  *	Implies this is a service we offer
* Other option: Only members are entitled to laser training.
  *	Doesn't account for people who ARE interested and want to learn, before becoming members. We want to encourage those people as best we can.
  * $15 day rate, and only cut a pre-defined design.
    * Refund if they become a member?
* Observation: since laser trainers are volunteers anyway, it's mostly up to them what they do and they can use their judgement.
  * Should we make a formal policy as guidance?
  * Or enforce a particular method?


No motion was specified here. Also note that two of the main laser trainers (who are also on the committee), are not present.
  * The chairman observes that a rule made for this could fundamentally change how the space works, especially for new members.
  * The committee present is not inclined to make a ruling until all of the committee has had the opportunity to review it and provide input.

**No motion**

*As an aside, the ability to create new motions (or radically alter existing ones) in "Other business" is a potential problem. Like Emergency Business, members are not given advance notice of the motion and do not have time to consider and provide input. However, unlike emergency business, there are no specific rules about how this is done (i.e. unanimous vote), and there is no inherent warning from the name "Emergency". A poorly-executed motion has the potential for severe consequences. We shoudl review this process, and meeting minutes more generally, before the next meeting.*
