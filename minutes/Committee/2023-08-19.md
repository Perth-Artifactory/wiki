### DGR application

Response from ATO requesting more information received 4 Aug.

**Drop dead deadline for response is 1 Sept.**

The chief issue appears to be that our public facing information (website, ACNC, etc) does not accurately reflect the evolution of the Association from a makerspace/performance venue to a community shed.

To quote the letter from the ATO (emphasis added) -

> **Dominant purposes**
>
> The dominant purposes of a community shed are advancing mental health and preventing or relieving social isolation.
>
> As your organisation operates a makerspace (or hackerspace), your main purpose is providing a welcoming safe space for people to come together to work on projects share ideas and socialise. The objects or purposes in your constitution includes promoting the creative use of technology, establish, maintain, and equip a shared workspace for its members, provide workspace, storage, and other resources for the creative and artistic use of technology and among others.
>
> Although in the ‘Key information’ section of your constitution showed the dominant purposes in Item B, this must be **consistent or should align with the information available to the public to demonstrate the main or dominant purpose** of your organisation as a community shed.
>
> Copy of Annual Reports (as per ACNC Register) and the information available on your website **does not specifically state the dominant purpose as a community shed**, therefore it is deemed that advancing mental health and preventing or relieving social isolation is your **secondary purpose or only incidental in achieving your main purpose as a makerspace facility provider**.
> 
> To enable us to make a decision on your application, please provide more information to demonstrate that you are complying with the requirements as a community shed - for example, **submitting copy of documentary evidence to establish that your activities support the dominant purposes** of advancing mental health and preventing or relieving social isolation, etc.

#### Plan of action

It would seem some or all of the following is required.

- Call the ATO and discuss
- Update our public facing information to reflect our community shed function.
- Explain to the ATO that our annual reports didn't reflect our community shed character before FY 2022-2023 because we only voted on our new constitution ("community shed" edition) in March 2023 and it was only endorsed by the Commissioner in June 2023, e.g. basically at the end of the financial year.
- Explain to the ATO that a makerspace is just what the *youths* call a community shed (and that we specifically don't call ourselves a community shed because it would not attract our target demographic).
- Explain and justify to the ATO why we specifically don't brand ourselves as a mental health support institution in our public materials ("destigmatising support").
- Provide hard documentary evidence (e.g. copies of emails) proving that people come to us for the same reasons they come to a community shed.
  - e.g. emails from people who are looking for groups of other people to work and socialise with. i.e. *"providing a physical location... supporting individuals to work on projects or undertake other activities in the **company of others at that location**."*
  - e.g. emails from support workers looking for community activities for their clients.
  - e.g. testimonials from those clients.
  

#### Actions taken so far:

- Renae is taking over from Lewis as the main point of contact with ATO.
- Renae is in the process of amending our ACNC information.
  - Has already updated our activities
  - Has already updated our beneficiaries ("who the charity helps"):
    - Adults - aged 25 to under 65
    - Adults - aged 65 and over
    - Females
    - Gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender or intersex persons
    - General community in Australia
    - People with disabilities
    - Youth - 15 to under 25
  - Adding the subtype "Advancing Health" (currently we are "Advancing Culture")
- Lewis has prepared most of the annual report (thank you to those who have helped so far). Our increase in community events this financial year will provide evidence to support our claims.
- Lewis has gone through our emails and picked out a number that support our position. Copies of these can be provided to ATO as hard documentary evidence (personal info redacted).

#### Actions still needed

- Update our website, socials, etc to better reflect our community shed focus
  - There is both writing and technical web dev aspects to this.
  - ACTION: Spondy to work on website.
- Complete ACNC change of charity subtype
- Update our presence on social media

### Scheduling AGM

**Lewis proposes that we hold the AGM on 16th Sept.**

We must hold our AGM within 3 months of the end of our financial year i.e. by 30th Sept. (rule 51.1)

If we are proposing a special resolution (which we are) we must send out the AGM notice 21 days before the AGM e.g. by Friday 25th Aug. (rule 53.1)

We must call for nominations to the committee at least 21 days before the AGM e.g. by Friday 25th Aug. (rule 33.1)

Lewis has already prepared the forms and notices reflecting 16th Sept in draft.
