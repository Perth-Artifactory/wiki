### Revision to the Classes of Membership and the Storage Bylaws

Loomio: [Revision to the Classes of Membership and the Storage Bylaws](https://vote.artifactory.org.au/d/D6vUFAmL/revision-to-the-classes-of-membership-and-the-storage-bylaws)

Ongoing effort to modernise our bylaws from last year.

Needs a final push to get this over the line. Volunteers?

Action: Fletcher to go through Loomio thread to pick out remaining issues.

### Introduce Family Membership

Loomio: [Introduce Family Membership](https://vote.artifactory.org.au/d/tOyArM8e/introduce-family-membership)

This was an idea from Lewis,

Consensus seems to be that an actual "family membership" may have unintended consequences as discussed in the Loomio thread.

The main people this would apply to at the moment seem to be happy with 1 primary member + 1 person coming in at casual Day Pass rate.

Lewis suggests taking no action at this time.

Further option discussed was to include "partner of existing member" as eligible for concession membership.

### Automotive Projects bylaws

Loomio: [Automotive Projects bylaws](https://vote.artifactory.org.au/d/rP563uHl/automotive-projects-bylaws)

This is an effort to formalise rules about working on vans, cars etc. to avoid repeat issues with automotive projects in the carpark and the front bay.

Currently in definition stage and requires some more definition from automotive knowledgable people to say what the rules need to be.

Beau and JC have discussed this.
* Van fitouts need to be a separate bylaw
* Current draft of bylaw just needs a cleanup and then it can go live.
* Action: JC will begin drafting bylaw for van fitouts.

### Workshop Induction

Loomio: [Workshop Induction](https://vote.artifactory.org.au/d/730YQk9z/workshop-induction)

We had previously decided that we needed a more robust workshop induction to:

* discharge our safety duty of care
* address recent incidents where lack of tool training was a factor
* make people aware of all our facilities and associated rules

**The workshop [induction](/testing/drafts/workshop-induction) is in final draft and is ready to be tested on someone.**

Following that we need to -

* decide who needs to do this induction (new people? existing members?)
  * Announce that we now have a induction, people are welcome to ask to run through it. If we see someone who needs additional training, run them through it.
  * Keyholder responsibilities - add responsibility to ensure visitors are appropriately inducted.
* write corresponding bylaws and
* set up required record keeping systems.
