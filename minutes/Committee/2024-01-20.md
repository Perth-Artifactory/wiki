2. Laser cutter training / authorization
    * Big red users need refresher training to learn what has changed after the upgrade.
    * ≈2/3rds of ≈40 eligible people have completed "fast track" refresher training.
    * Thanks Fletcher for committing substantial time for this re-training campaign.

3. Air dryer for Big Red donated by Steve.

### Western Leathercraft workshops

Refer Loomio thread - [Western Leathercraft class conditions](https://vote.artifactory.org.au/d/NnMHQKR9/western-leathercraft-class-conditions-).

Outcomes:

* Event bookings now need to be made through committee, so needs of Western Leathercraft events are coordinated with Artifactory events.
* Immediate concerns communicated via email and will be addressed.

Further discussions:

* Beau and Fletcher have clarified requirements in person this afternoon.

Changes being discussed in Loomio:

* Minimum attendance numbers for events.
* Financials of running events in our venue.

### Garage Sale

RE: selling excess equipment to a) make money and b) recover space.

Sell things which aren't owned by members, which we aren't using, and which we aren't likely to use.

First showing at Arduino U, give away consumables to members, small amounts for free, contributions for significant amounts. Also gives Arduino U people an opportunity to identify what's worth keeping and what's not.

Second - general garage sale open to the public.

Third - open to anyone to take, otherwise we dispose.


### Tool training / competency records

We have recently had a few near misses where lack of tool training was a contributing factor.

We need to change how we do tool training and assessment, without going over the top.

#### Proposed policy

Draft [training policy](/testing/drafts/training). 🟢🟡🔴

What stays the same:

* 🔴 tools have a tool-specific list of trainers. E.g. laser trainers are still a specific appointed list of people.
* 🔴 tools still require Artifactory specific training and assessment.

What changes:

* We need to maintain a list of every tool vs the 🟢🟡🔴 category. See [tool list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19nyCU9O5BlZ_-NMCTVj_YCgkSNRWerTCKvBf7bQnnJI/edit?usp=sharing).
* 🟡 and 🔴 tools need to be visibly marked.
* There will need to be an authorised set of trainers for 🟡 tools.
* People could previously use 🟡 tools with no checks. People will now need to be signed off to use 🟡 tools. 
* User-friendly way of checking and recording training has been developed to support this.

Benefits:

* No more confusion about who can use what tools. It is now tracked and easily checked.
* Opportunity to fill gaps in 🟡 tool training which would previously have gone un-noticed.
* Having a list of all our tools (in 🟢🟡🔴 categories) means that it is now very easy to answer enquiries about "do you have tool X" (one of our most common questions).

#### Administration

A Slack bot, [@Training Tracker](https://perart.io/check_training),

1. Lets anyone check their own training status easily, and
2. Lets authorised trainers modify training records easily.

Authorised trainers are appointed by adding them to a group (@trainers) on Slack. This gives them admin access to Training Tracker and adds them to the #infra_training channel.

Training bookings have been moved to a dedicated Slack channel (#training-and-inductions) which replaces all previous ways of booking training (e.g. #lasers, #tools-and-fabrication).

#### Implementation - 🟡 tools

Existing members will need to get signoffs for the tools they are already competent with.

Most members can go through the list of 🟡 tools with a trainer, and quickly agree which tools they are already competent with. This is doable in 10 minutes. All members have been very co-operative with this process so far.

This process also gives us a chance to reinforce correct practices with 🟡 tools and reinforce our [Code of Conduct](/docs/committee/code_of_conduct) re *Safe Use of Tools*.

Policy for this as follows:

> We recognise the negative short term impact the implementation of this system may have on existing members if they are unable to get quick access to a sign off on a tool they normally use. A grace period for medium-risk (yellow) tools that did not previously have a formal sign off is in place while we get everyone in the new system.
{.is-info}

#### Implementation - 🔴 tools

Existing operator lists for 🔴 tools have been imported.

We are also adding people who were missing off the existing lists.

Policy for this as follows:

> We began implementing this system in January 2024. If you were trained on a machine/tool prior to January 2024, and you are not listed as an authorised operator, please contact us to get your entry updated.
