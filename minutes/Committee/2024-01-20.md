### Tool training / competency records

We have recently had a few near misses where lack of tool training was a contributing factor.

We need to change how we do tool training and assessment, without going over the top.

#### Proposed policy

Draft [training policy](/testing/drafts/training). 🟢🟡🔴

What stays the same:

* 🔴 tools have a tool-specific list of trainers. E.g. laser trainers are still a specific appointed list of people.
* 🔴 tools still require Artifactory specific training and assessment.

What changes:

* We need to maintain a list of every tool vs the 🟢🟡🔴 category. See [tool list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19nyCU9O5BlZ_-NMCTVj_YCgkSNRWerTCKvBf7bQnnJI/edit?usp=sharing).
* 🟡 and 🔴 tools need to be visibly marked.
* In addition to the existing sets of trainers for 🔴 tools, there will need to be an authorised set of trainers for 🟡 tools.
* People could previously use 🟡 tools with no checks. People will now need to be signed off to use 🟡 tools. 
* User-friendly way of checking and recording training has been developed to support this.

Benefits:

* No more confusion about who can use what tools. It is now tracked and easily checked.
* Opportunity to fill gaps in 🟡 tool training which would previously have gone un-noticed.
* Having a list of all our tools (in 🟢🟡🔴 categories) means that it is now very easy to answer enquiries about "do you have tool X" (one of our most common questions).

#### Administration

A Slack bot, Training Tracker, has been developed to a) let members check their own training status, and b) let trainers easily update records.

Authorised trainers are appointed by adding them to a group (@trainers) on Slack. This gives them admin access to Training Tracker.

Training bookings have been moved to a dedicated Slack channel (#training-and-inductions) which replaces all previous ways of booking training (e.g. #lasers, #tools-and-fabrication).

#### Implementation - 🟡 tools

Existing members will need to get signoffs for the tools they are already competent with.

Most members can go through the list of 🟡 tools with a trainer, and quickly agree which tools they are already competent with. This is doable in 10 minutes. All members have been very co-operative with this process so far.

This process also gives us a chance to reinforce correct practices with 🟡 tools and reinforce our  [Code of Conduct](/docs/committee/code_of_conduct) re *Safe Use of Tools*.

Policy for this as follows:

> We recognise the negative short term impact the implementation of this system may have on existing members if they are unable to get quick access to a sign off on a tool they normally use. A grace period for medium-risk (yellow) tools that did not previously have a formal sign off is in place while we get everyone in the new system.
{.is-info}

#### Implementation - 🔴 tools

Existing operator lists for 🔴 tools have been imported.

We are also adding people who were missing off the existing lists.

Policy for this as follows:

> We began implementing this system in January 2024. If you were trained on a machine/tool prior to January 2024, and you are not listed as an authorised operator, please contact us to get your entry updated.
