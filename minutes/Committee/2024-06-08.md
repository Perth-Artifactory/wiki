## Treasurer's Report

The Treasurer's Disclaimer: The numbers below have been calculated in a quick way and have not undergone robust checking as for an Annual Report.

Membership Income for the month is down $1,000 from average. It does historically vary significantly month to month due to billing due dates being on the last day of the month, and members who do not pay regularly. Worth monitoring to ensure it is just an outlier as expected.

| Income May 2024               | Balance       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------- |
| Memberships                   | $3,417.59     |
| Donations                     | $3,387.59     |                 
| **TOTAL Income**              | **$9,718.99** |



| Expenses May 2024             | Balance        |
| ----------------------------- | -------------- |
| Equipment/Infrastructure      | $1,463.42      |
| Lease and running costs       | $5,701.12      |  
| **TOTAL Expenses**            | **$7,820.97**  |

We have a significant amount of membership invoices which are overdue.
- Some members are historically irregular payers.
- Many new members expect memberships to be paid automatically or just never return but continue to be invoiced.
- Some require special effort by the membership officer to send out in particular ways.
- We are also recovering from some administrative errors here a group was double invoiced, so their membership is renewing a month in advance, and some annual invoices which were issued with an incorrect year in the due date.

I'm putting significant hours into reducing the amount showing as overdue. 

Help required: 

1. I have a list of long-standing members who are intermittent payers. Can people with strong relationships with them please volunteer to reach out and encourage them to pay regularly, explaining the importance of regular income, and the time wasted in us following up. Automatic monthly direct bank transfer preferred.

2. New members: We seem to have lost a bit of control over new members who sign up after tours, or at other times when we don't have a chance to conduct workshop inductions. An important part of the induction needs to be that payments are not taken automatically, and they need to set up monthly transfers, or pay invoices on time as they receive them. Suggestions requested.

* We need a new member induction to cover basic stuff. Code of conduct, training system and payment setup.

* Base this on the new member guide.

* Train more people to deliver the new member induction.

**Action**: Lewis to review new member guide with above objectives in mind.



| Membership outstanding        | Balance     |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- |
| Not yet due                   | $2,565      |
| Overdue                       | $5,865      |
| -                             | -           |
| Unlikely to recover           | $1,110      |
| Uncertain recovery            | $1,650      |
| Likely to be paid             | $5,670      |

### Infrastructure and Equipment Fund

* Thanks to all who have donated!

    * Pledges: $5,300 from 8 people
    * Direct deposits: $1,240 from 4 people

### Junior Associate Membership category 

There is a [Loomio thread](https://vote.artifactory.org.au/d/m6QrRab5/creation-of-new-associate-membership-category-for-under-18s) about creating an associate membership category for people under 18. Consensus seems to be rate to be the same as concession membership, but without voting or keyholding rights.

* **Action - Lewis/Renae** - Develop this idea further on Loomio. Consider contingencies. Risk assessment of individual children in a workshop environment. Review minors in the space protocol.

### Training fees

Charging for laser training for non-members, but not expecting volunteer time has created an imbalance with members who would prefer to pay for training instead of volunteering their time. Discuss either expecting non-members to volunteer as well as paying $15 for laser training, or significantly increasing price for non-member training

* Fletcher: There is an amount of responsible-volunteer time required to onboard new people with how to meaningfully contribute volunteer time. A push to more volunteer time requirements may have an unintended side effect of overburdening responsible-volunteers. 

* No action required at this time.

### Update filament tool usage fees

Loomio thread: https://vote.artifactory.org.au/d/f7A9sciN/change-to-printer-usage-fees

**Currently:**

> Cost basis
> * Weight of part including supports, as printed. (Weigh using the digital scales in the Design Lab.)
> 
> Member rate
> * \$0.05 / gram, rounded up to the nearest \$1.00
> 
> Day Pass rate
> * \$0.15 / gram, rounded up to the nearest \$1.00
> 
> 
> Inclusions
> * Filament
> 
> Exclusions
> * N/A

**Proposed:**

> Cost basis
> 
> * Weight of part including supports/purging as outlined by the slicer. (Use slicer weight but not slicer cost).
> * When a print is cancelled a best effort estimation of filament used should be made using the bench top scales in the room.
> * Filament is split into tiers based on material cost and equipment wear.
>     * The authoritative reference for filament categorisation is the [filament stock](/tools/3dprinters/filament_stock) page. 
>     * Filament categorisation is determined by the 3D Printers Subcommittee.
> 
> Member rate
> 
> * Tier 1: $0.05 / gram
> * Tier 2: $0.10 / gram
> * Tier 3: $0.15 / gram
> * Tier 4: $0.20 / gram
> 
> Rounded up to the nearest $1.00 at the end of the day.
