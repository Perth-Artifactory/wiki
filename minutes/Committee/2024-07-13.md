## Correspondence

We recieved a complaint from a member regarding a committee member.
* The compliant was handled by Renae, who discussed the complaint with all involved parties.
* Renae also sought input from Lewis.
* The complaint has been resolved to the apparent satisfaction of the member.
* Actions arising from this process are -
>  1. The committee will compose guidance to trainers on dealing with any possible perceived conflict of interest when training or assessing.
>
>  2. The committee will discuss and make a decision on how we ensure appropriate currency of training on all tools.

Item 1 has been [discussed in Loomio](https://vote.artifactory.org.au/d/1cP5szqK/conflict-of-interest-issues-for-trainers). Final actions have not yet been agreed.

Item 2 - we will draft a proposal to address this in Loomio.

## Incident Reports

A member sustained a minor (first aid treatment) injury while using the drill press.
* [Refer Loomio thread.](https://vote.artifactory.org.au/d/UNCPs7LX/)
* Fletcher and Ben met with the member on 13 July regarding the use of the drill press without having received training. The member was apologetic and made assurances there would be no recurrence.

## Property Report

* Business as usual

## Chairperson's Report

* Business as usual
* JC getting good feedback from the general public RE the work we have been doing to upgrade the space.
* Loomio working well to keep track of long term discussions.
* Space looked great on Saturday open day - thanks to all who helped

## Treasurer's Report

The Treasurer's Disclaimer: The numbers below have been calculated in a quick way and have not undergone robust checking as for an Annual Report.

* Significant one-off income this month: Mainly infrastructure donations and Women's Woodworking Course fees.

* Low membership income from last month recouped this month, natural variation due to due date being on month cutoff.

* Reconciliation of accounts has started, hoping to complete before next month's meeting.

* Supanova income will land in July's figures.

### Expense Report

Intention is to include all expenses for the month to improve financial accountablilty.

Authorisations need to be updated, as they do not currently cover some situations where the money has been directly collected for that purpose. This includes Pledges and Talkshop event food. Discussion in general business.

It will take some time to calculate the money paid out in these categories, and a vote will be raised to cover it.

Please be careful to get the total amount right when raising pledges. You need to account for delivery fees, GST and any international transaction fees. TidyHQ fees can be accounted for separately under our general income.

### Supanova - post-event report

* Thank you all volunteers who helped with Supanova prep and being the Face of the Artifactory at Supanova!
* We handed out ~ 800 flyers to interested people after having conversations with them, which is converting to Open Day attendance
* We sold approx $4,000 of merchandise.
* Our costs associated were approx $1000. (Flyer printing, material costs for sale items, printer power usage)

### Upcycle rack

Discussion in Slack #virtual-upcycle-bench.

Variety of suggestions including -

* Keep as is - periodic purge
* Delete the upcycle rack - go virtual only
* Require approval to put items into upcycle rack
* Date of entry for items going into upcycle rack - items "expire" after 1 month

### Financial authorisations 

Renae:

* We are already seeing a significant increase in the money going through our accounts since our DGR approval, I want us to hold ourselves to a high standard of financial accountability. 

* The current authorisations are insufficient to effectively meet our responsibilities. 

* The current authority bylaw is ["Artifactory Expenses"](https://wiki.artifactory.org.au/en/docs/policies/administration#artifactory-expenses).

> The Committee allows the Treasurer to pay/reimburse for the following expenses without needing to seek committee approval. The Treasurer may defer reimbursements until a meeting of the Management Committee at their discretion.

* Our subcommittees do not operate or report the same way they did when the bylaw is drafted.
* We need to decide on authorisation procedure for Pledges and Talkshop food.
* Loomio is working well for voting, looking to output a report on expenditure authorisations.
* Are we happy with giving retrospective approval? Seems like it is overused at the moment.
* Consider issuing Eftpos cards to more officebearers to avoid money going directly from Artifactory to committee members (bad look). How would we manage this?

### Set date for AGM

* Propose to have our AGM on Saturday 14th September 2024
  * This (nearly) aligns with the Artifactory's 15th birthday/ :)
  * *First meeting at Mt Lawley HJ's - 15th Sept 2009.*
  * ❗ Notices must be sent out 21 days before - Fri 23rd August.
