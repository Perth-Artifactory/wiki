### City of Wanneroo - repair / reuse workshops

Enquiry via email from a Waste Education Officer at City of Wanneroo - JC has spoken with them.

> As I mentioned we are simply looking for ways to increase repair skills and knowledge within our community through any of the following ways:
> 
> * Information sharing sessions to inspire community members to explore repair and reuse of items ‚Äì possibly by skill specific, i.e. woodworking or metal working
> * Skill sharing workshops (simple tool skills) to support basic repair or reuse of materials
> * Possibly learn to fix it sessions to do basic woodwork/ soldering repair skills on items participants bring with them
> 
> At this time we are seeking indicative quotes to have someone facilitate any of the about so we can apply for a WasteSorted Community Education Grant that closes Mon 19 Aug.
> 
>  
> 
> If successful with this grant we would be looking to hold these sessions between Feb ‚Äì May 2025 so hopefully plenty of time to work out the finer details of what‚Äôs possible. We would be more than happy for facilitators to promote the opportunities available for community members through your group during these sessions.
> 
>  
> 
> If your group is able to support us can you please send through indicative quotes by Wednesday 14th Aug.

Discussed on Loomio.

We won't be able to provide a quote on their timeline.

JC will contact them to let them know.

## Other Business

### Tool training - conflict of interest policy

Subsequent to Loomio thread - [Conflict of interest issues for trainers](https://vote.artifactory.org.au/d/1cP5szqK/conflict-of-interest-issues-for-trainers),

**Proposed actions:**

* Add the following to the [Training](/docs/policies/training) policy:

> Trainers must disclose actual or potential conflicts of interest regarding their relationships with trainees.
>
> Where an actual or potential conflict of interest exists, the outcome of the training must be endorsed by a third party.

#### Motion

| Motion Text | Moved by    | Seconded by       | Status            |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Add conflict of interest section to training policy, as proposed. | Fletcher       | JC          | Accepted/Rejected |

#### Action items

* Fletcher - Communicate changes to trainers

### Tool training - training refresher policy

We do not currently have any procedure for training expiry or refreshers.

* Periodic refreshers may be needed to maintain perishable skills and knowledge.
* When we modify our tools (e.g. recent Big Red controller replacement), re-training may be needed to communicate the changes.
* Our training content changes over time (e.g. as we learn from actual and near miss incidents).

I propose a policy that allows us to require refresher training when justified, without mandating it in all cases.

I haven't taken a position on fees/costs for refresher training.

**Proposed actions:**

* Add the following to the [Training](/docs/policies/training) policy:

> **Refresher training and training expiry**
>
> Authorized operators may be required to undergo refresher training for a tool if -
>
> * It has been more than 12 months since they last used the tool, or
> * The tool has changed significantly since their last training, or
> * The operating procedures for the tool have changed significantly since their last training.
>
> The authority which sets the training requirements for the tool will determine if and when refresher training is required, on a risk assessment basis.
>
> If an authorized operator needs refresher training, a reasonable notice period will be provided before their authorization expires.

#### Motion

| Motion Text | Moved by    | Seconded by       | Status            |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Add refresher training and training expiry section to training policy, as proposed. | Fletcher       | Tegan          | Accepted |

#### Action items

* Communicate changes to members via Slack #announcements
* Update New Member Induction
* Fletcher - Communicate changes to trainers

### Tool training - tool inductions policy

Our [bylaw regarding tool inductions](/docs/policies/bylaws#tool-inductions) currently states:

> **Tool inductions**
> 
> Adopted at committee meeting 2019-12-07.
> 
> The Infrastructure Subcommittee may gate dangerous tools behind a tool specific induction at their discretion and appoint trainers.
> 
> A list of gated tools and appointed trainers must be made available on the wiki and on or near the tools themselves.

This should be updated to reflect:

* Lasers and 3D Printers Subcommittees manage training for those areas.
* We don't maintain a list of appointed trainers near specific tools.

**Proposed actions:**

* Delete the [existing tool inductions policy]((/docs/policies/bylaws#tool-inductions)). Replace it with a link to the [Training](/docs/policies/training) policy.

* Add the following to the responsibilities of the [Infrastructure Subcommittee](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructurev2). (Same as existing wording for Lasers and 3D printers.)

> * Appoint tool trainers as required, except for tools where that function is delegated to another subcommittee.
> * Determine training requirements as required, except for tools where that function is delegated to another subcommittee.

* Add the following to the [Training](/docs/policies/training) policy:

> **Trainer appointments and training requirements**
>
> Trainers are appointed, and training requirements are determined, by the following groups:
>
> * Laser cutters: [Lasers Subcommittee](/docs/lasers/lasers)
> * 3D printers: [3D Printers Subcommittee](/docs/3dprinters/3dprinters)
> * All other tools: [Infrastructure Subcommittee](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructurev2)

* Amend the terms of reference for the 3D Printers Subcommittee as follows (changes in **bold**)

> **Terms of reference**
>
> **The 3D Printers Subcommittee is in charge of:**
> 
> * **3D printers, and**
> * **3D scanners.**
> 
> **The 3D Printers subcommittee will:**
>
> * Control modifications and upgrades to the 3D printers, balancing usability for general users vs. capability upgrades for enthusiasts.
> * Make recommendations to the main committee **~~on all aspects of 3D printer~~ regarding** maintenance, operation, upgrading, training and charging.
> * Appoint **~~3D printer~~** trainers as required.
> * Determine training requirements as required.
> * Scheduling operational and preventative maintenance.
> * Organising the ordering and installation of replacement parts within a budget determined by the main committee.
