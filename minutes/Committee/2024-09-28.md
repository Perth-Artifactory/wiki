- Following the AGM meeting, feedback from members was overall positive, though there was a request for more transparency on how committee decisions are made.
- It was good to meet new members over the following week and observe how training and inductions impacted them.
- New members have been cautious when using yellow/red tools, often asking for a second opinion or supervision.
- It’s great to see members refer others to the Artifactory, as seen from random visitors after the AGM on Saturday. Thank you to those who help spread the word.

### Fridge + Vending Machine

Discussion on programming and stock allocation.
- Restocking currently done by Anthony on Thursdays

### Loomio

From JC:

Management committee polls and sense checks : feasibility to make public to members, after decisions are finalised.

* Renae (absentee input):
  * All decisions are documented in committee meeting minutes, perhaps post link to minutes once finalised in general channel?

Set specific dates/times for committee decisions and polls (e.g., expense approvals on specific days) to ensure all members know when to check. This is in contrast to alerts, which may come at inconvenient times.)

* Renae (absentee input):
  * Very inconvenient to restrict expense approval polls creation to specific days - this is usually volunteers putting in their own time to get needed items for the space. If you just set up alerts on #committee_important you get notified of new polls with a link to vote - leave the alert visible until it is convenient for you to vote? It is critical that expense polls are raised in a timely fashion.

### Code of conduct report

See original report and discussion in [Loomio](https://vote.artifactory.org.au/d/J61DSWpu/code-of-conduct-report-rami-nakamura-by-sophie-murday) (confidential - committee only).

Decision required on issuing a RFID key to one of the involved people, whether deferred to review at a later time, or refused.

### Annual review of event fees

Renae:

Propose to review event fees annually, to ensure we are clear on who pays what.
As casual fees have gone up to $20, my proposal is:

| Event              | Current | Proposed | Communication |
| ------------------ | ------- | -------- | ------------- |
| Modsynth           | unknown | $15 per person direct deposit only | Fletcher to communicate? do we need a notice period for increase? |
| Arduino U          | $10 | No increase | Ren to communicate to Blake, ? to update Meetup |
| PLUG               | $5 | No increase | Ren to communicate to Nick |
| Leathercraft       | $15 | $20 | Ren to communicate to Andrew | 
| Metal Monday       | $15 | $20 | ? to update calendar, Meetup |
| Social Wednesday   | $15 | $20 | ? to update calendar + RSVP template, Meetup |
| Woodwork Wednesday | $15 | $20 | ? to update calendar, Meetup |
| Board Games        | $5 | No increase | No communication required |
| Laser Maintenace   | ? | $0 | Fletcher to communicate with Blake |
| Open Day           | $0 | No increase | No communication required |
| General Hacking    | $15 | $20 | ? to update calendar, Meetup |

Lewis:

Also need to update day pass rate everywhere else.
* Website
* Wiki (search to make sure we got them all)
* Meetup

### Annual nominations for honorary memberships

Renae:

These are designed to keep people who have made significant contributions connected to the space while they are not able to maintain memberships.

Includes -
* Waived day pass rate 1× a month.
* Waived door fee (not food fee) for Social Wednesdays.
* Explicitly not a membership and confers no membership benefits.

2024/25 Nominations -

- Bruce Chambers
- Beau Scott

Lewis - Implementation details?

### Visitor memberships

Renae:

We need to communicate more clearly that casual users need to sign up in our system as visitors before touching any tools. This covers their liability waivers etc.

Not sure whether this needs to include Arduino attendees.
