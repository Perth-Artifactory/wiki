## Chairperson's Report

We continue to receive a steady stream of inquiries from interested individuals, particularly regarding our yellow and red tools (lathes/CNCs), which require membership due to the significant volunteer time involved. It‚Äôs encouraging to see when this interest translates into real engagement when individuals attend for first time, complete the induction process, and check in on the whiteboard.

I‚Äôm pleased to note that most members have either addressed outstanding membership dues or have communicated their intention to pause or cancel. Timely payments would greatly assist us with our pay cycles, so please double-check your payment schedule, especially if you've been a member for more than six months.

It‚Äôs fantastic to see members enthusiastic about running workshops to upskill both members and the public, as well as to foster a sense of community. If anyone has time to run or assist with workshops, please speak to a committee member, and we can help make it happen (including scheduling, bookings, and event promotions). A special shout-out to Vincent for running his first Soldering Workshop; this has great potential to become a regular event, especially with ArduinoU involved.  Looking forward to see the Possum Box Build day from Dan get going‚Ä¶

The Wednesday social gatherings have been well-attended, offering a great opportunity to see how new members align with the AF ethos and code of conduct. It‚Äôs also been wonderful to see some of our regular members coming out of their shells, gaining confidence in their skills and feeling comfortable in the space to be themselves. This is a positive sign of the nurturing environment we've cultivated. Shoutout to Sophie & Tom for their efforts in the install of the Rainbow Lighting ceiling system. Great project initiated and overseen by Fletcher. Makes the space look awesome for these social events.
 
We have acquired some new equipment! A big thank you to the 3D printing committee and volunteers for managing the logistics of bringing this substantial 3D printer into our space‚Äîit‚Äôs sure to be a major draw.

Additionally, I‚Äôd like to recognise Sophie for her efforts in dismantling, rebuilding, as well as conducting ongoing 3D printing training. Sophie‚Äôs contributions, along with the maintenance and testing of prototypes, do not go unnoticed.

Special thanks to Penny for her great work on acquiring and installing the new adjustable height feature for the sandblasting cabinet.

## Treasurer's Report

The Treasurer's Disclaimer: The numbers below have been calculated in a quick way and have not undergone robust checking as for an Annual Report.

September: While we are showing a monthly loss of $4,500, this was expected. This is a combination of the annual adjustment of our variable outgoings ($2,000), the deposit for the shadesails (Infrastructure Funds amount collected in previous months), and tool purchases (where funds were collected in August)

October: Positive Income of $1,000 for the month.

We are going to need to budget for an increase in our lease. Discussions ongoing at this point. While an increase is wholly reasonably, I am mindful that we were close to being insolvent around 6 months ago. I think it would be worthwhile to document all initiatives implemented in this time, to help us be aware of what has changed for us, and to measure the security of our financial position. The major risk is that we have a high proportion of inactive memberships where their future payments are not guaranteed.

In the short term: strong membership numbers, timely payments and effective follow up of unpaid invoices have put us in a good position.

### Due invoices

Total Due - $8.310
Total Overdue at 30 September - $2,845
Total Overdue at 31 October - $3,455

Overdue amount includes $1,080 from 2 annual invoices sent with incorrect(future) due date
They have been submitted to providers, so are unable to be changed.
They were both sent with due dates of 1/3/2025.
We have been advised that one will not be paid due to recent changes in NDIS rules. Unsure if the other will get paid.

Overdue amount increased due to lack of resources to follow up, this has been done this week. Thanks JC.
Hopefully the change to require keyholders to pay via bank transfer will encourage more direct debits.

* Possum box construction
  * Renae has assisted, this has resolved

### Rehearsal Room Coordinators

* Business as usual

### Quartermasters

* Large bar restock completed, next up is chips

### Membership Officer

* üü¢ 16 new member inductions completed since last meeting
* üü¢ New member induction has been edited based on delivered sessions
  * üü° In particular the way we convey the Code of Conduct has changed. Suggest committee members review
  * Changes most easily viewed [here](https://github.com/Perth-Artifactory/wiki/commit/c2dedc63089c179623e7af46256177b636212ca1)
* üü° New member guide is likely no longer fit for purpose now that we have an in person induction.
  * I've been drafting a more general alternative that guides people from interested to keyholder.
  * Feedback welcome on [the guide](/testing/drafts/the_plan)
  * New member guide would shift focus to a general [Member Handbook](/testing/drafts/member-handbook)
* üü¢ A self paced visitor induction has been drafted as well
  * [Editable text](/docs/slides/visitor_orientation)
  * [Presentation mode](https://slides.artifactory.org.au/visitor_orientation)
* üî¥ Currently we track attendee progression with :star2:nothing:star2: and new members with a variety of Slack pins. This is not sustainable and we are missing things.
  * Feedback requested on the progression [proposed here](https://github.com/perth-Artifactory/taiga_sync/).
  * The live version of this board can be found by signing up [here](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au). Please use the same GitHub account you use for Teleport and let Fletcher know if you've signed up.
  * Some changes have been made to statuses and tasks on GitHub that haven't made it to Taiga yet, assume GitHub is the master plan.
  * Every one of the proposed tasks with a ‚úÖ in the `Closed by code` column has already been automated.
  
### Membership Storage Officer

* üü¢ Requests being met in a timely fashion

## Subcommittee Reports

Updates from subcommittees - discussions or requests for action.

### Laser Subcommittee

* üü° Both lasers out of service over the weekend (unrelated to each other)
  * Thank you to Tom for his work on Saturday prepping Middle Red for laser maintenance this past Monday.
* üî¥ We may want to budget for a tube replacement late next year. $1,000-1,500 (based on numbers purely in Fletcher's head that have not been backed up by research yet üòò)
* üü¢ A couple of new maintenance attendees over the past two months
* üü° No movement on the fibre laser, will need ~$200 in funding to complete enclosure.

### IT Subcommittee

* üü¢ We've been trialing a project management tool, Taiga.
  * https://tasks.artifactory.org.au
  * Currently being tested for membership tracking (see Membership Officer) and workshop reports (See Infrastructure)
* üî¥ In space server is struggling to keep up with our security camera demands.
  * This is leading to lag on other tools like Silphco, Training Tracker, Home Assistant
  * Fletcher has purchased a suitable dedicated NVR
  * The new NVR will also allow us to use newer cameras while still supporting all bar two of our existing ones.
  * The equipment needs 4x HDDs to function. Our recording setup means that \<x\>TB of space does not equate to \<y\> days of storage as storage requirements fluctuate depending on workshop activity.
    * [Seagate Ironwolf 6TB](https://www.msy.com.au/product/seagate-ironwolf-6tb-5400rpm-3-5in-sataiii-nas-hard-drive-st6000vn006-69514) 4x$259 = $1,036 18T usable $57.55 $/T
    * [Seagate Ironwolf 8TB](https://www.msy.com.au/product/seagate-ironwolf-8tb-7200rpm-3-5in-nas-sataiii-hard-drive-st8000vn004-51482) 4x$278 = $1,112 24T usable $46.33 $/T
    * [Seagate IronWolf 10TB](https://www.msy.com.au/product/seagate-ironwolf-10tb-7200rpm-3-5in-sata-hard-drive-st10000vn000-64977) 4x$369 = $1,476 30T usable $49.20 $/T
* üü¢ New workstations set up in the design lab. Two usable workstations up to five. (two additions, one changed)
  * Space for one more once some more woodworking is done
* Development things not covered elsewhere since last meeting:
  * Added a new report on [keyholder status](https://reports.tele.artifactory.org.au/pages/keys.html)
  * Membership approval report changed to provide better feedback, added export for easy addition to minutes
  * Added an encrypted URL translation service that hooks into Teleport, we can now create links on public documents that provide extra information to authenticated users without compromising information in the URL. (ie TidyHQ contact links)
  * Contributed fixes upstream for our filament management system, Spoolman (Thanks Tom!)

### Promotions Subcommittee

* üî¥ Miscommunication with Bunnings caused October's Halloween market to not happen for us
* PrideFEST Fairday tomorrow
* Next Bunnings market will be their Christmas event

### Associate Memberships Panel

* Nothing to report

### Infrastructure Subcommittee

* üü¢ Design lab has been rearranged and a new desk put in, doesn't it look pretty
* üü¢ Sandblaster has a new height adjustable table, thanks Penny!
* üü° New thicknesser fundraised, needs a bit more TLC before it's operational (Ben/Renae/Fletcher)
* üü¢ Sublimation/heat press equipment donated, Dave is going to take a look at getting the printers working
  * Includes a lot of clothing/vinyl as well
  * Rest of the related equipment will be stored until Dave has the printers working
  * üü° Long term storage plan for the equipment needs to be planned out. We can likely add more storage to the Design Lab for other equipment (not suitable for heat presses due to weight)
* üü¢ We no longer have a use for the shell of the old metal lathe. Ben is going to look into what we can get for it. [Loomio](https://vote.artifactory.org.au/d/LWNvfjPX/equipment-disposal-metal-lathe-shell)
* üü¢ We likely don't have a need for the half converted CNC mill, we may be able to get ~$500 for it. [Loomio](https://vote.artifactory.org.au/d/39qpcnKH/equipment-disposal-cnc-mill-project-milldred-)
* üü¢ 34 tracked tool inductions completed since last meeting
  * This doesn't include laser/printer trainees that have completed training but not assessment
* üü° Uptick in queries regarding BYO tools, policy likely required [Loomio](https://vote.artifactory.org.au/d/cABHoyYg/byo-tools-policy)
* üü¢ Trialing a new reporting/management system
  * Slack users can report tool damage etc from within Slack
  * We've been losing track of some projects since Trello went away
  * Should help us keep track of all the infra projects we have on the go
* üî¥ The front door developed an issue last week [Issue tracker](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/5)
  * The component has been fixed but it may be prudent to have a replacement on hand. It'll cost somewhere between $150-300 (haven't looked at shipping costs etc)


### 3D Printers Subcommittee

* üî¥ Prusa XL is not in a state where it'll be operational soon
  * Fundamental problems with the heads
  * Cannot easily sell the machine as the serial number is registered as recalled
	* Plan is to stow on ceiling until more volunteer hours can be dedicated
* Voron going on ceiling for the moment
* Modix V3 120X donated, has been partially rebuilt in the print room while we plan out the next steps for getting it operational.
* Training is shifting to a training/assessing model similar to lasers
* Losing track of some projects as we expand, will explore Taiga alongside infra

* We have negotiated with the agent and agreed an increase to $38,000 per annum.
* Ben has analysed our finances - we can sustain $38k/annum at least in the near term.
* See Renae's comments above in Treasurer report RE longer term sustainability.
* Last email 1 Nov:
  * To arrange a extension and variation of the lease effective 1 Aug 2024 with rent increasing to $38,000 per annum + variable outgoings + GST.
