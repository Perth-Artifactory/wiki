## Chairperson's Report

Over the past few months, the management committee have been in discussions to secure a new lease arrangement for our cherished space. I’m pleased to report that we are close to finalising the agreement, However, as expected, the new lease comes with a rent increase.

 This adjustment places additional pressure on our financial buffer, making it more important than ever to monitor our operational position on a monthly basis.

This is where we need your support: timely payment of membership fees is essential. Your contributions  help us meet our financial obligations and plan confidently for the future.

We encourage members to set up a direct transfer from your bank each month, as this not only saves us on fees, but reduces volunteer time following up on late payments.

On a positive note, the new lease offers greater stability, moving us from a month-to-month arrangement to a longer-term agreement. This provides us with a solid foundation to continue growing as a vibrant hub for makers, innovators, and creators.

I’d like to take this opportunity to thank our incredible members, dedicated volunteers, trainers, and event hosts for your ongoing support, enthusiasm, and commitment throughout 2024.

P.S.: Don’t forget the NYE edition of Talkshop Socials – happening Tuesday, 31st December, at 6:00 PM at Perth’s BEST Makerspace, 8/16 Guthrie Street, Osborne Park.
