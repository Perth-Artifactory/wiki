## Chairperson's Report

JC sends his apologies and has submitted this report in advance.

> Apologies I cannot be here for the first meeting of 2025.
> 
> I want to acknowledge the dedication that keeps the Artifactory running, especially through the “quieter” December–January period. As a volunteer-driven space, we rely on our Committee Members, Event Hosts, and Trainers, and their well-earned time off highlighted just how vital our volunteers are.
>
> Thank you to everyone who contributed their time and effort during this “quieter” period, in order for the Artifactory to remain open and operational. 
> 
> Special Shout-out to Fletcher, for implementing the Taiga system, which has been instrumental in helping committee members and new volunteers navigate reporting and track space projects. As more members engage with it, we hope to see a mix of fresh faces and returning members reinvigorating our community.
>
> Please check this out (tasks.artifactory.org.au or in Slack - Taiga App), as it is a valuable asset, in managing the space and members needs.
>
> Our Committee, Trainers and event hosts continue to do fantastic work, ensuring members are well-equipped to make the most of the space.
>
> If you're keen to get involved, or haven’t visited in a while, please reach out we’d love to reconnect + ensure everyone is on the same page, especially when pitching the Artifactory to prospective new members.
>
> I’ll close with a question: What is the Artifactory to you, and how would you describe it to others?
>
> I once likened it to a gym—except instead of lifting weights, you pay to use tools and technology. That is still somewhat true, but looking at 2025 and forward, I'd like to encourage the Artifactory to others, as a creative playground of tools and technology, but more importantly, a safe space where people can make, learn, and share.

## Treasurer's Report

Strong membership numbers and generally prompt payment of membership fees has saan us continue to travel well, even with the significant increase in rent. The backpay of the increase is included in the December figures, with the new rent reflected in January.

Our biggest project funded by our infrastructure fund has been successfully completed, with the wonderful shade sails installed in the courtyard. The feedback from members has been overwhelmingly positive, increasing the usability of the space to a significant degree. Thanks to all who contributed financially, and assisted in other ways.

## Officer Reports

Reports to be emailed in for review of committee when officer does not attend meeting.

### Event Officer

* Librarians of Alexandria (A Pox-Eclipse clan) have asked us about hosting a costume/cosplay day. Fletcher has followed up.

### Rehearsal Room Coordinators

* JC on behalf of Martin G : advises room left in mess, particularly PA system cables unplugged and left in mess. posted in Slack and Facebook Rehearsal Room group.
  * Fletcher confirmed not related to any infrastructure, has reached out to Aaron.
  
Going forward we have a few options:

1. Do nothing — members remain frustrated.
2. Make band representatives accountable for the state of the room at the end of their session, as is expected in other areas of the space.
3. Raise the band room fee to better reflect market rates, with increased revenue subsidising our time spent cleaning and tidying.
4. Assess whether the band room (currently occupied by two bands paying $100/month each) provides sufficient benefit to the space or if it could be repurposed for alternate projects, given the premium on space.


* ACTION: JC to advise band reps of committee discussion and highlight that same rules apply as rest of Artifactory. Keep it clean and tidy.

* ACTION: Fletcher to discuss PA cabling with Aaron's band.

### Quartermasters

* Largely business as usual, (see: vending machine in other business)

### Membership Officer

* 9 member inductions completed since last meeting (up to 25/02/12 arvo)
* Open day was busy, turned into a few new members

### Membership Storage Officer

* Requests are being met

## Subcommittee Reports

Updates from subcommittees - discussions or requests for action.

### Laser Subcommittee

* With Big Red relatively stable we've been able to start working through some of our long term planned changes
  * Work on [integrating the air dryer](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/lasers/us/23?kanban-status=40) has continued
  * After more investigation we've abandoned some of our plans regarding the [rotary axis](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/lasers/us/16?kanban-status=39), it will continue working as before
* We've got an opportunity to add a new extractor to an existing freight order, this more than halves the cost of purchasing the extractor we need for the fibre laser.
  * The new extractor is larger than the existing Big Red extractor.
  * The existing Big Red extractor will become the new Middle Red extractor.
  * The existing Middle Red extractor will become the Fiber Laser extractor, which we would other need to buy.
  * Extraction on Big Red is currently one of our most common reactive maintenance tasks, this should reduce that.

| ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Approve up to $250 to purchase a new laser extractor | Fletcher    | Lewis             | Accepted |

### IT Subcommittee

* We've migrated to the [new NVR](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/it/us/29) and planned out [camera upgrades](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/it/us/69)
* All the screens in the design lab (and big red) have been [mounted on arms](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/it/us/46) to free up desk space
* The wiki has a new sidebar to make navigation easier
* Work continues on website upgrades (in particular we now have tool tips to help convey extra information)
* A bunch of backend tech stuff has happened that affects maybe 3 people tops but makes our lives easier (Coder, Vault)
* The `Silphco` session limit has been fixed (long time issue that negatively impacted volunteers)

### Promotions Subcommittee

* Magnus is meeting with the Supanova rep responsible for floor plans, aim is to lock in Supanova earlier so we can better prepare
* No word yet on Bunnings markets for this year, first one will likely be Easter
  * ACTION - Renae to reach out to Bunnings rep to confirm next Bunnings event at Easter.

### Associate Memberships Panel

* Nothing to report

### Infrastructure Subcommittee

* 🟢 = Good thing or thing resolved
* 🟡 = Thing isn't good but a resolution is in the works
* 🔴 = Thing isn't good and there's no resolution planned yet

----

* 🟢 48 tool inductions since last meeting (up to 25/02/12 arvo)
* 🟢 We've announced an [open meeting/town hall](https://perthartifactory.slack.com/archives/C01J9C6LHE1/p1739004164637549) to discuss the next stage of changes to the space
* 🟢 Shade sails are up!
* Pricing signage
  * 🟢 [3D signage](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/61) is up
  * 🟡 [Machining signage](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/125) has been proofread and is ready to go
* 🟡 [Kitchen sink tap aerator](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/50) has hit a speedbump, will need to order an adapter online, make it, or replace the tap
* 🟡 The [leak above the electronics lab](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/issue/130) is still likely to be an issue come winter/heavy rain.
* 🟢 The ink lines on the [sublimation printer](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/56) have been purged (Thanks Dave)
* 🟢 The power cable tub has been purged of non compliant cables, the rest have been bundled neatly (Thanks Ilke)
* 🟡 The entry notice system used by Renae is offline, we don't have an ETA for it coming back online but there's some software alternatives we can explore
* 🔴 The BBQ likely just needs to be replaced, the amount of work required to get it operational exceeds the cost of getting one from marketplace.
* 🔴 We've received a report that the metal lathe is knocking at high speed, no resolution yet.
* 🟢 The dry oven is operational again (Thanks Lewis P and others), we also have new [operating procedures](https://wiki.artifactory.org.au/en/tools/dry-oven)
* 🟡 The [replacement door strike](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/5) has arrived, we're making some changes to our existing wiring before putting it in
* 🟡 There's a potential hole in the skylight above the project area, closer investigation hasn't revealed a hole but we may need to get up there with a hose to find out for sure.
* 🟢 The [drill press motor adjustment knob](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/76) was modelled, printed, and replaced (Thanks Adam)
* 🟢 The [power control for the wood bandsaw](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/43) had an issue and was fixed.
* 🟢 The [thicknesser](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/69) is operational on the front outlet (maybe the back as well by the time this meeting comes up) 
* 🟢 We investigated both of our kilns and decided which one we wanted to keep and a plan of action going forward. (Thanks LewisP and Dean)
* 🟢 More electronics components have been sorted
* 🟢 The RH pallet rack has had a shelf adjusted to accommodate the plastic chairs used for larger events
* 🟢 The material to the right of that rack has been sorted/purged and moved near the upcycle rack
* 🟢 The ladders have been [mounted on the wall](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/182?kanban-status=19)
* 🟢 The EWP now has a parking spot to the right of the racking
* 🟢 We received a [donation from Bosch/WOTT](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/251)
  * Mitre saw (18V)
    * Plan for the source is to build a home for it in the bench outside, that way in can be taken out there as required
  * 5" grinder (240V)
  * Impact driver (18V)
  * Circular saw (18V)
  * 🟡 We'll need to source batteries for these, currently we have a single 4Ah battery which won't be suitable for the saw
    * Renae has reached out to her Bosch contact and asked to borrow some of the larger batteries for the weekend to test the mitre saw and see what we actually need

We've started drawing up plans for things we want to discuss at the town hall:

### Vending Machine

From: Fletcher

The vending machine is leaking. How much are we willing to spend?

* Asking members for help hasn't brought up any leads
* Fridgie callout is $150, gassing/leak detecting may be more
* Vending machine does make bar restocks significantly easier (reduces restock frequency)

* Discussion - a substantial amount of volunteer effort has gone into the vending machine and we should put some money into fixing it.

* ACTION: Fletcher will reach out to a refridgeration mechanic and find out pricing to inspect the vending machine. Fletcher will then raise an online motion to approve the cost.

### Volunteering tokens

From: Renae

* There are 2 parts to this - recognising our major volunteers, and formalising the setup where some people have alternate arrangements for paying for drinks/snacks.

* Where people are making a significant volunteer effort (not as part of clean for training), it would be nice to offer a free soft drink.

Suggestion:

* Event hosts for Artifactory Events - 1 drink per event

* Work on approved projects - 1 drink for every full hour completed.

* Tokens with initials to be put in a container as the drink is taken, to make it obvious to all members that people are not just helping themselves when they feel like it (as has been queried previously)

* A separate container can be used for tokens where the drink is being donated to giant robot, so that the volunteer time can still be recognised.

* Anyone putting in more than 10 hours in a month gets their own supply of personalised tokens

Discussion:

* All in attendance in agreement with this idea.

* Need to communicate this so that it is clear that this is a system to recognise volunteer effort, not just giving free drinks to people.

* Tegan suggests running a trial of this before committing to permanent implementation.

Actions:

* ACTION: Renae to detail how the volunteering tokens system would be regulated procedurally. Raise in Loomio.

* ACTION: Fletcher to detail physical implementation of the volunteering tokens section (or delegate to another).

### Dangerous projects policy

From: Fletcher

We've drafted a [revised dangerous projects policy](https://wiki.artifactory.org.au/en/testing/drafts/dangerous_projects) and put it out for [community feedback](https://vote.artifactory.org.au/d/LlwCkaI4/revisions-to-our-dangerous-projects-and-tools-policy). It is ready to put into place. 

Discussion:
* Need to insert a record keeping requirement of dangerous projects which have been assessed and approved. Will pass policy as written and amend after.

### Day pass project restrictions

From: Fletcher

Projects covered by our dangerous projects policy will take more volunteer time and Artifactory resources. If people want to work on these types of projects they should join as members.

### Vehicle fitout restrictions

From: Fletcher

Vehicle fitouts (and the attendees that do them) take up a disproportionate amount of volunteer time and Artifactory resources. Then as soon as the project is completed they leave to go travelling. Vehicle fitouts should require committee approval and largely should only be considered if:

* The applicant is a keyholder
* The applicant has been a member for at least six months

| Motion Text | Moved by    | Seconded by       | Status            |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Require vehicle fitouts to be approved by the committee. Committee to follow application guidance as written. | Fletcher | Lewis | Accepted |

### Code of Conduct violation

From: Fletcher

* A member has repeatedly failed to follow our operating procedures for 3D printers. They have also failed to follow/repeateldy disregarded strongly worded advice from our trainers.
* The actions put the machine at risk but not attendees
* This week the behaviour caught up with them and took a printer offline after they failed to check that the first layer of a print was put down successfully
* A review of the security footage confirms that they started the job, walked away, and never looked at the machine again
* Stepping back through the footage for this week this is not the only occurrence
* The failed print irreparably damaged the hotend assembly, including an expensive beta unit we were asked to beta test by a supplier
* The 3D printers subcommittee has temporarily suspended their printer inductions
* The feeling from printer maintainers is that the member frequently engages in risky prints and maintainers are left holding the bag every time things go wrong
* The advice from members of the subcommittee is that the types of prints the member wants to print are ill suited to our machine setup and they would be better placed purchasing their own smaller printer that is better equipped for FDM miniature printing

----

> The exact words of the conversation have been relayed to the committee in private
{.is-info}

* The member acknowledges their mistake and that this was not the first time they'd failed to follow our operating procedures
* The member has offered to cover the cost of machine repairs and made a separate $150 voluntary donation as an apology to the volunteers for having to fix the machine

----

Discussion - proposed course of action.

* Written warning - code of conduct.
* Reminder to follow established operating procedures, especially for high risk tools, e.g. lasers.
* 3D printer access to be revoked indefinitely.
* RFID key access to remain.
