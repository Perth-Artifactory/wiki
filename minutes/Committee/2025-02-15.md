Strong membership numbers and generally prompt payment of membership fees has saan us continue to travel well, even with the significant increase in rent. The backpay of the increase is included in the December figures, with the new rent reflected in January
Our biggest project funded by our infrastructure fund has been successfully completed, with the wonderful shade sails installed in the courtyard. The feedback from members has been overwhelmingly positive, increasing the usability of the space to a significant degree. Thanks to all who contributed financially, and assisted in other ways.

### Infrastructure Subcommittee

* We've announced an [open meeting/town hall](https://perthartifactory.slack.com/archives/C01J9C6LHE1/p1739004164637549) to discuss the next stage of changes to the space
* Shade sails are up!

  * [3D signage](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/61) is up
  * [Machining signage](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/125) has been proofread and is ready to go
* [Kitchen sink tap aerator](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/50) has hit a speedbump, will need to order an adapter online, make it, or replace the tap
* The [leak above the electronics lab](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/issue/130) is still likely to be an issue come winter/heavy rain.
* The ink lines on the [sublimation printer](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/56) have been purged (Thanks Dave)
* The power cable tub has been purged of non compliant cables, the rest have been bundled neatly (Thanks Ilke)
* The entry notice system used by Renae is offline, we don't have an ETA for it coming back online but there's some software alternatives we can explore
* The BBQ likely just needs to be replaced, the amount of work required to get it operational exceeds the cost of getting one from marketplace.
* We've received a report that the metal lathe is knocking at high speed, no resolution yet.
* The dry oven is operationl again (Thanks Lewis P and others), we also have new [operating procedures](https://wiki.artifactory.org.au/en/tools/dry-oven)
* The [replacement door strike](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/5) has arrived, we're making some changes to our existing wiring before putting it in
* There's a potential hole in the skylight above the project area, closer investigation hasn't revealed a hole but we may need to get up there with a hose to find out for sure.
* The [drill press motor adjustment knob](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/76) was modelled, printed, and replaced (Thanks Adam)
* The [power control for the wood bandsaw](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/43) had an issue and was fixed.
* The [thicknesser](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/69) is operational on the front outlet (maybe the back as well by the time this meeting comes up) 
* We investigated both of our kilns and decided which one we wanted to keep and a plan of action going forward. (Thanks LewisP and Dean)
* More electronics components have been sorted
* The RH pallet rack has had a shelf adjusted to accommodate the plastic chairs used for larger events
* The material to the right of that rack has been sorted/purged and moved near the upcycle rack
* The ladders have been mounted on the wall
* The EWP now has a parking spot to the right of the racking
* We received a [donation from Bosch/WOTT](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/251)
  * Mitre saw (18V)
    * Plan for the source is to build a home for it in the bench outside, that way in can be taken out there as required
  * 5" grinder (240V)
  * Impact driver (18V)
  * We'll need to source batteries for these, currently we have a single 4Ah battery which won't be suitable for the saw

We've started drawing up plans for things we want to discuss at the town hall:

* [Design lab shelving](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/143)
* The new [wood zone](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/189)
* Redoing the [tool wall](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/201)
* [Enclosing](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/203) the mill/lathe area
* Cladding [more of the ceiling](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/223)
* Reworking the [lighting in the courtyard](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/234) now that the shade sails are up
* Renovating the [kitchen](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/250)

### OTHER BUSINESS EXAMPLE

<!--- DO NOT DELETE UNTIL DAY OF MEETING --->

### Vending Machine - Fletcher


### Volunteering tokens - Renae
There are 2 parts to this - recognising our major volunteers, and formalising the setup where some people have alternate arrangements for paying for drinks/snacks.
Where people are making a significant volunteer effort (not as part of clean for training), it would be nice to offer a free soft drink.

Suggestion:
Event hosts for Artifactory Events - 1 drink per event
Work on approved projects - 1 drink for every full hour completed.

Tokens with initials to be put in a container as the drink is taken, to make it obvious to all members that people are not just helping themselves when they feel like it (as has been queried previously)
A separate container can be used for tokens where the drink is being donated to giant robot, so that the volunteer time can still be recognised.
Anyone putting in more than 10 hours in a month gets their own supply of personalised tokens
