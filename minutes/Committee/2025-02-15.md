## Chairperson's Report

JC sends his apologies and has submitted this report in advance.

> Apologies I cannot be here for the first meeting of 2025.
> 
> I want to acknowledge the dedication that keeps the Artifactory running, especially through the “quieter” December–January period. As a volunteer-driven space, we rely on our Committee Members, Event Hosts, and Trainers, and their well-earned time off highlighted just how vital our volunteers are.
>
> Thank you to everyone who contributed their time and effort during this “quieter” period, in order for the Artifactory to remain open and operational. 
> 
> Special Shout-out to Fletcher, for implementing the Taiga system, which has been instrumental in helping committee members and new volunteers navigate reporting and track space projects. As more members engage with it, we hope to see a mix of fresh faces and returning members reinvigorating our community.
>
> Please check this out (tasks.artifactory.org.au or in Slack - Taiga App), as it is a valuable asset, in managing the space and members needs.
>
> Our Committee, Trainers and event hosts continue to do fantastic work, ensuring members are well-equipped to make the most of the space.
>
> If you're keen to get involved, or haven’t visited in a while, please reach out we’d love to reconnect + ensure everyone is on the same page, especially when pitching the Artifactory to prospective new members.
>
> I’ll close with a question: What is the Artifactory to you, and how would you describe it to others?
>
> I once likened it to a gym—except instead of lifting weights, you pay to use tools and technology. That is still somewhat true, but looking at 2025 and forward, I'd like to encourage the Artifactory to others, as a creative playground of tools and technology, but more importantly, a safe space where people can make, learn, and share.

## Treasurer's Report

Strong membership numbers and generally prompt payment of membership fees has saan us continue to travel well, even with the significant increase in rent. The backpay of the increase is included in the December figures, with the new rent reflected in January

Our biggest project funded by our infrastructure fund has been successfully completed, with the wonderful shade sails installed in the courtyard. The feedback from members has been overwhelmingly positive, increasing the usability of the space to a significant degree. Thanks to all who contributed financially, and assisted in other ways.

## Subcommittee Reports

Updates from subcommittees - discussions or requests for action.

### Laser Subcommittee

* With Big Red relatively stable we've been able to start working through some of our long term planned changes
  * Work on [integrating the air dryer](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/lasers/us/23?kanban-status=40) has continued
  * After more investigation we've abandoned some of our plans regarding the [rotary axis](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/lasers/us/16?kanban-status=39), it will continue working as before
* We've got an opportunity to add a new extractor to an existing freight order, this more than halves the cost of purchasing the extractor we need for the fibre laser.
  * The new extractor is larger and will shunt everything down the line like hermit crabs waiting for shells. (big red to middle, middle to fibre)
  * Extraction on Big Red is currently one of our most common reactive maintenance tasks, this should reduce that.

### IT Subcommittee

* We've migrated to the [new NVR](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/it/us/29) and planned out [camera upgrades](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/it/us/69)
* All the screens in the design lab (and big red) have been [mounted on arms](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/it/us/46) to free up desk space
* The wiki has a new sidebar to make navigation easier
* Work continues on website upgrades (in particular we now have tool tips to help convey extra information)
* A bunch of backend tech stuff has happened that affects maybe 3 people tops but makes our lives easier (Coder, Vault)
* The `silphco` session limit has been fixed (long time issue that negatively impacted volunteers)

### Infrastructure Subcommittee

* 🟢 = Good thing or thing resolved

* 🔴 = Thing isn't good and there's no resolution planned yet

----

* 🟢 48 tool inductions since last meeting (up to 25/02/12 arvo)
* 🟢 We've announced an [open meeting/town hall](https://perthartifactory.slack.com/archives/C01J9C6LHE1/p1739004164637549) to discuss the next stage of changes to the space
* 🟢 Shade sails are up!
* Pricing signage
  * 🟢 [3D signage](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/61) is up
  * 🟡 [Machining signage](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/125) has been proofread and is ready to go
* 🟡 [Kitchen sink tap aerator](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/50) has hit a speedbump, will need to order an adapter online, make it, or replace the tap
* 🟡 The [leak above the electronics lab](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/issue/130) is still likely to be an issue come winter/heavy rain.
* 🟢 The ink lines on the [sublimation printer](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/56) have been purged (Thanks Dave)
* 🟢 The power cable tub has been purged of non compliant cables, the rest have been bundled neatly (Thanks Ilke)
* 🟡 The entry notice system used by Renae is offline, we don't have an ETA for it coming back online but there's some software alternatives we can explore
* 🔴 The BBQ likely just needs to be replaced, the amount of work required to get it operational exceeds the cost of getting one from marketplace.
* 🔴 We've received a report that the metal lathe is knocking at high speed, no resolution yet.
* 🟢 The dry oven is operational again (Thanks Lewis P and others), we also have new [operating procedures](https://wiki.artifactory.org.au/en/tools/dry-oven)
* 🟡 The [replacement door strike](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/5) has arrived, we're making some changes to our existing wiring before putting it in
* 🟡 There's a potential hole in the skylight above the project area, closer investigation hasn't revealed a hole but we may need to get up there with a hose to find out for sure.
* 🟢 The [drill press motor adjustment knob](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/76) was modelled, printed, and replaced (Thanks Adam)
* 🟢 The [power control for the wood bandsaw](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/43) had an issue and was fixed.
* 🟢 The [thicknesser](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/69) is operational on the front outlet (maybe the back as well by the time this meeting comes up) 
* 🟢 We investigated both of our kilns and decided which one we wanted to keep and a plan of action going forward. (Thanks LewisP and Dean)
* 🟢 More electronics components have been sorted
* 🟢 The RH pallet rack has had a shelf adjusted to accommodate the plastic chairs used for larger events
* 🟢 The material to the right of that rack has been sorted/purged and moved near the upcycle rack
* 🟢 The ladders have been [mounted on the wall](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/182?kanban-status=19)
* 🟢 The EWP now has a parking spot to the right of the racking
* 🟢 We received a [donation from Bosch/WOTT](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/251)
  * Mitre saw (18V)
    * Plan for the source is to build a home for it in the bench outside, that way in can be taken out there as required
  * 5" grinder (240V)
  * Impact driver (18V)
  * 🟡 We'll need to source batteries for these, currently we have a single 4Ah battery which won't be suitable for the saw
    * Plan right now is to reach out to Renae's Bosch contact and ask to borrow some of the larger batteries for the weekend to test the mitre saw and see what we actually need

We've started drawing up plans for things we want to discuss at the town hall:

* [Design lab shelving](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/143)
* The new [wood zone](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/189)
* Redoing the [tool wall](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/201)
* [Enclosing](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/203) the mill/lathe area
* Cladding [more of the ceiling](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/223)
* Reworking the [lighting in the courtyard](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/234) now that the shade sails are up
* Renovating the [kitchen](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/infrastructure/us/250)

### 3D Printers Subcommittee

* 🟢 First round of the restock is complete and on the shelves, second round on it's way
* 🟡 The X1 needs repair, we're still assessing the extent of the damage

### Vending Machine - Fletcher

The vending machine is leaking. How much are we willing to spend?

* Asking members for help hasn't brought up any leads
* Fridgie callout is $150, gassing/leak detecting may be more
* Vending machine does make bar restocks significantly easier (reduces restock frequency)

### Volunteering tokens - Renae

There are 2 parts to this - recognising our major volunteers, and formalising the setup where some people have alternate arrangements for paying for drinks/snacks.
Where people are making a significant volunteer effort (not as part of clean for training), it would be nice to offer a free soft drink.

Suggestion:
Event hosts for Artifactory Events - 1 drink per event
Work on approved projects - 1 drink for every full hour completed.

Tokens with initials to be put in a container as the drink is taken, to make it obvious to all members that people are not just helping themselves when they feel like it (as has been queried previously)
A separate container can be used for tokens where the drink is being donated to giant robot, so that the volunteer time can still be recognised.
Anyone putting in more than 10 hours in a month gets their own supply of personalised tokens

### Dangerous projects policy - Fletcher

We've drafted a [revised dangerous projects policy](https://wiki.artifactory.org.au/en/testing/drafts/dangerous_projects) and put it out for [community feedback](https://vote.artifactory.org.au/d/LlwCkaI4/revisions-to-our-dangerous-projects-and-tools-policy). It is ready to put into place.

### Day pass project restrictions - Fletcher

Projects covered by our dangerous projects policy will take more volunteer time and Artifactory resources. If people want to work on these types of projects they should join as members.

### Vehicle fitout restrictions - Fletcher

Vehicle fitouts (and the attendees that do them) take up a disproportionate amount of volunteer time and Artifactory resources. Then as soon as the project is completed they leave to go travelling. Vehicle fitouts should require committee approval and largely should only be considered if:

* The applicant is a keyholder
* The applicant has been a member for at least six months

| Motion Text | Moved by    | Seconded by       | Status            |
