Strong membership numbers and generally prompt payment of membership fees has saan us continue to travel well, even with the significant increase in rent. The backpay of the increase is included in the December figures, with the new rent reflected in January
Our biggest project funded by our infrastructure fund has been successfully completed, with the wonderful shade sails installed in the courtyard. The feedback from members has been overwhelmingly positive, increasing the usability of the space to a significant degree. Thanks to all who contributed financially, and assisted in other ways.
