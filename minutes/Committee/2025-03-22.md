## Chairperson's Report

It’s been largely business as usual over the past period. One highlight worth mentioning has been the positive interactions we've seen with new members. It’s been great to see fresh faces not only joining but also engaging actively within the space.

Thank you to our trainers and regular members who consistently step up to help new members feel welcomed into the community. This kind of support is invaluable as it fosters a strong, inclusive culture and ensures that new members feel confident and encouraged to get involved.

As always, the more engaged members we attract, the more regular funding we generate. This in turn allows us to invest back into the space whether that’s upgrading existing infrastructure or acquiring new tools and equipment. It’s a clear sign of a healthy, growing community, and it’s thanks to the collective effort of all involved.

## Treasurer's Report

The Artifactory continues to be in a strong financial position. The monthly surplus includes damage restitution for the broken printer that will be spent in future month, ($1710) as well as a contribution from PLUG for past meetup expenses ($630).

Our power usage has been increasing significantly - 4400 units in the past 60 days, compared with 3700 last bill, and 3170 this time last year. Our bill for this period is $1,250 (will show in next month figures). I'm looking for input on what may be causing this, as I do not believe there has been particularly high laser or 3d print usage in this timeframe (17 Dec 2024 - 18 Feb 2025)

We are looking to spend significant funds in the next few months on infrastructure upgrades. Ideally some of this could be covered by grants. Ben has taken responsibility for applying for these - discuss with him on his return

### By-law / Membership class cleanup

The raw text of the suggested changes are on [GitHub](https://github.com/Perth-Artifactory/wiki/compare/main...bylaw-cleanup?diff=unified&w=).

#### Artifactory Expenses

Notes:

* Reshuffled items to make a bit more logical sense ("virtual" things first)
* Remove building bonds, these aren't an everyday expense and were listed as a byproduct of no online motions
* Added clarifying examples
* Add Secretary incurred fees
* Removed the distinction between kitchen items for sale vs provided
* Explicitly added Pledge Bot payouts
* Explicitly covered food events
* Expanded public building authorisation to explicitly include things like fire equipment

Change to:

The Treasurer is authorised to reimburse/pay for the following expenses without seeking committee approval. The Treasurer may refer a particular payment to the Management Committee for approval at their discretion.

* Lease and variable outgoings
* Bank and merchant fees
* Utilities (eg. internet, welding gas, rubbish disposal, and electricity)
* Fees associated with maintaining the membership database (eg. TidyHQ)
* Filing and administration fees incurred by the Secretary (eg. DMIRS)
* Public building compliance costs (eg. fire extinguishers, fixtures, event toilets)
* Kitchen and bar restocks
* First aid, toiletry, office, and cleaning supplies
* PPE
* Items for use by a subcommittee of the organisation provided that the total amount is less than $75 and the expense has been approved by the head of the relevant subcommittee.
* Purchases funded by fundraising campaigns (eg. Pledge Bot)
* Purchases funded by event ticket sales

#### Duties Delegated by the Secretary

Notes:

* Remove bank signatories
* Add Membership Officers
* Cleaned up constitution references

Change to:

* The Office bearers, Deputy Treasurer, Deputy Secretary, and Membership Officers are authorised to accept written notices of resignation under section 10 of the constitution.
* The Office bearers, Deputy Treasurer, Deputy Secretary, and Membership Officers are authorised to assist the Secretary maintain the register of members under section 13 and clause 30.4 of the constitution.

#### Events and Workshops

Notes:

* Cleaned up wording
* Clarified loud tools
* Changed rehearsal room conflict wording
* Rename by-law to Event Authorisations

Change to:

* Any committee member may authorise a new event if it:
  * will bring in the day pass minimum rate per attendee (excluding members)
  * does not require exclusive access of the Artifactory
  * does not conflict with another event/workshop unless the hosts of the other event see no conflict
  * will not conflict with attendees using loud tools (eg. mill, welders)
  * does not require the rehearsal room to be reserved
* The Chair and any three other committee members may waive the above rules if it is considered beneficial to the Artifactory to do so. The decision must be documented at the next regular committee meeting

#### Money Donations

By-law removed. The parts that prescribed accounts are better left to Treasurer discretion. The donation/tax advice was also misplaced.

#### NeverNever

Notes:

* NeverNever balances should not be increased under any circumstances and the concept has been phased out.

Changes:

* Remove the provision that NeverNever balances may be added to at a committee meeting.

#### Physical Keys + Safe Access

Notes:

* We don't use the safe to store valuables anymore
* There we no provisions for giving front door keys
* Updated TidyHQ reference to membership database
* Renamed to Physical Keys

Change to:

* Physical keys are issued at the discretion of the Management Committee to assist with emergency access to the workshop.
* A record of who has physical keys to the Artifactory shall be maintained in the membership database by the Secretary.

#### RFID Keys for Members / RFID Keys for Non-members

Notes:

* Rolled the non member by-law into a single line and expanded to include tasks other than event hosting
* Restriction application process to Ordinary Members (full/concession/band) and sponsored memberships.
  * Specifically sponsored rather than sponsored student to allow for other types of sponsored memberships in the future
  * Removed bond limits for memberships that are no longer applicable
* Renamed to 24/7 Access, RFID was unnecessarily specific

Change to:

* Separate to the application process detailed below the committee may grant 24/7 access to anyone performing a task on behalf of the organisation for the purpose of performing that task. (eg. external event hosts)
* All ordinary and sponsored members may apply to the committee for 24/7 access to the space. The committee will approve the application provided that the member -
  * Has held their current membership for at least two weeks,
  * Has not acted against the interests of the Association,
  * Pays a bond appropriate to their membership class,
  * Has no outstanding invoices,
  * Pays their membership invoices via bank transfer (not card),
  * Is competent to make decisions on who can enter the space, and
  * Has demonstrated an ability to -
    * Work unsupervised,
    * Undertake tasks safely,
    * Clean their work area, and
    * Communicate any issues to committee.
* 24/7 access may be revoked at the discretion of the committee should any of the above no longer be true.
* When a member moves to a different membership class the bond amount shall be the lesser of the classes
* Members requesting keys must submit a head/shoulders photo suitable for identification purposes. The Secretary or Treasurer may rule that a provided picture does not meet these requirements at their discretion.
* The member must maintain accurate personal and emergency contact details in the Artifactory's member management system (e.g. TidyHQ) at all times.
* The Chair, Treasurer and any two other committee members may waive the bond if it is considered beneficial to the Artifactory to do so. The decision must be documented at the next regular committee meeting.
* Bond amounts are as follows:

| Membership                       | Bond |
| -------------------------------- | ---- |
| Full Membership                  | $225 |
| Concession Membership            | $135 |
| Band Membership                  | $100 |
| Sponsored Student Membership     | $135 |

#### Membership classes

Notes:

* Update band membership to 4 slots instead of 3
* Limit number of bands to 2 (the current amount) in preparation for phasing out band memberships in favour of rehearsal room subscriptions
* Removing unnecessary clarifying statement on voting rights for bands

Change to:

|      |      |
| ---- | ---- |
| **Eligibility criteria** | Any person over 18 years of age, who represents a band. (The *nominated contact person* for the band.) All members of the band must be over the age of 18 or supervised by a parent/guardian as per our [by-laws](/docs/policies/bylaws#minors-in-the-space). |
| **Special rules for this class of membership** | N/A |
| **Type of membership (ordinary or associate)** | The *nominated contact person* in the band is an *ordinary member* |
| **Membership fee** | $100 per month, payable monthly. |
| **Use of communal areas - social area, kitchenette, and toilet facilities** | Yes |
| **Use of the indoor and outdoor workshop areas** | Social use (Day Pass required for projects) |
| **Use of workshop tools, equipment, computers, etc.** | Day Pass required |
| **Tool usage fees** | The "**day pass** rates" listed under [Tool Usage Fees](/docs/policies/fees). |
| **Can store property at the space** | No |
| **Use of rehearsal room** | Yes - three bookings per month. Additional bookings subject to availability. |
| **Fees to attend Artifactory-run events and workshops** | Free entry for band members to ModSynth building nights held on the Artifactory premises. Otherwise, the non-member rate for the event. |
| **Eligible for 24/7 access** | A single key per band used only for accessing the space when a rehearsal is booked. Issue of keys is subject to our [by-laws](/docs/policies/bylaws). Secondary keys may be issued at the discretion of the Management Committee. |
| **Amount of bond for 24/7 access** | Refer to the [by-laws](/docs/policies/bylaws). |
| **Maximum number of members in this class of membership** | 2 |

* Band membership entitles each band to the following:
  * 4 rehearsal slots/month;
  * Extra bookings may be made if a slot is free, no earlier than 48 hours in advance of the time you are booking

#### Minors in the space

Notes:

* The changes here are to formatting rather than intent

Change to:

Our space is a collaborative workshop, not a child care service. Minors (people under the age of 18) are welcome to attend and participate in the space, provided they are supervised by a responsible guardian.

The guardian must ensure that the minor –

* Complies with our policies and procedures (e.g. the Training policy and Code of Conduct).
* Follows all appropriate safety requirements (e.g. wears appropriate PPE).
* Is not endangered by activities occurring in the space.
* Does not interfere with members and attendees.
* Does not consume alcohol.

Different levels of supervision are required based on the area and the activities occurring in the area.

* For _General supervision_, the guardian must be –
  * present in the space, and
  * able to see the minor, and
  * generally aware of what the minor is doing.

* For _Active supervision_, the guardian must be –
  * in the same area as the minor, and
  * actively aware of what the minor is doing, and
  * ready to physically intervene if required.

* Any attendee can temporarily declare that an area is an _active supervision area_, based on the presence of –
  * Hazardous conditions or activities, e.g. power tools, spray painting, hot works.
  * Something easy to damage, e.g. wet paint, delicate parts.

|   | Minors – Under 13 years | Minors – Under 18 years |
| - | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Low risk areas** <ul><li>Social Area</li><li>Design Lab</li><li>Kitchen</li><li>Project area</li><li>Rear Courtyard</li></ul> | General supervision | General supervision |
| **Medium risk areas** <ul><li>Rehearsal room</li><li>Electronics / 3D printing lab</li><li>Laser area</li></ul> | Active Supervision | General supervision |
| **High risk areas** <ul><li>Machining bay</li><li>Welding bay</li><li>Machine room</li><li>Any area temporarily declared to be an active supervision area.</li></ul> | Active Supervision | Active Supervision |

#### Officers

Notes:

* The IT Officer line is unnecessary
* Membership Storage Officer has been trimmed, unnecessary clarifications removed, and references to the wiki updated to reflect that lockers are managed through the membership database

Changes:

* Remove "Act with the best interest/level of service of the Artifactory Members in mind" from IT Officer
* Change "Able to add RFID access" to "Can manage applications for, and the provisioning of, 24/7 access" for Membership Officer
* Update Quartermaster restocking to "Coordinate member stocking of the bar, kitchen, toilets, and other communal supplies stocked by the organisation"

Change Membership Storage Officer to:

* Maintain the register of all Member Storage areas within the Artifactory.
* Ensuring all Member Storage are identified and labelled.
* Maintain a wait list for Member Storage requests if required
* Assist the Committee in allocating storage space to members
* Ensuring storage spaces are cleared prior to making them available for reallocation.
* Conducting audits of the Member material racks & Member Storage to ensure material storage is consistent with applicable by-laws.

#### Subcommittee guidance

Remove, page is unnecessary and it's unclear whether it's a by-law

#### Subcommittees

Notes:

* Comments on the management committee, while well meaning, do not belong in this by-law
* Subcommittees should put things on the wiki, not random public pages
* Standard wording should be "name" not "full name"
* Subcommittee minutes shouldn't need to be public, ie sponsored memberships

Changes:

The full text can be viewed [on GitHub](https://github.com/Perth-Artifactory/wiki/blob/bylaw-cleanup/docs/policies/subcommittees.md), too long to include here.

* Remove out of place reference to Management Committee obligations
* Remove reference to subcommittee guidance
* Update public web page references to wiki
* Change obligation for public records of membership from full name to name
* Remove obligation that subcommittee minutes must be public
