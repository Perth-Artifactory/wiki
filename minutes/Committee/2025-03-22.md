## Treasurer's Report

The Artifactory continues to be in a strong financial position. The monthly surplus includes damage restitution for the broken printer that will be spent in future month, ($1710) as well as a contribution from PLUG for past meetup expenses ($630).

We are looking to spend significant funds in the next few months on infrastructure upgrades. Ideally some of this could be covered by grants. I would like to resuggest the formation of a grants subcommittee, noting that no grant proposals have been submitted in the year since an alternative solution was agreed upon.
