## Correspondence

* Enquiry from Gosnells library RE presenting a 3D printer information/training session.
  * Fletcher following up
* Insurance broker has indicated that our insurer is no longer willing to provide grouped policies like ours. (Where public liability, product liability, directors, contents etc are rolled into one). They're looking at sourcing policies piecemeal instead.
  * Fletcher acting as point of contact
  * Broker doesn't seem concerned, not sure if we should be
  * Fletcher has outlined our insurance priorities to the broker, ie public liability, event, and directors indemnity are more of a pressing concern than contents.
  * Fletcher will keep the committee appraised in general but there'll be a specific notice if there's an issue with our directors indemnity.
* Enquiry from City of Stirling Economic Development Officer to arrange a meeting at the space.
  * Fletcher has proposed a meeting time, Renae/Fletcher to attend.

## Chairperson's Report

While I’ve been overseas recently, it’s been great to see that things have largely continued on as business as usual at the Artifactory. This really speaks to the dedication and effort of our community, especially our volunteers, who keep things ticking along.

That said, it’s worth acknowledging that we are heavily reliant on volunteer availability, and unfortunately that meant we had to pull out of our recent Bunnings community event. It was reported that we were missed, which is a real shame, but hopefully it’s a reminder of how valued our presence is at these types of events.

On a more positive note, the new RSVP system on slack for social events, and open days is a great initiative (cheers Fletcher as always for continuous improvements). Hopefully it helps encourage more people to get involved and makes it easier for us to plan and run events in the future.

Thanks again to everyone who’s been helping out, your support is what keeps this place going.

## Treasurer's Report

The Treasurer's Disclaimer: The numbers below have been calculated in a quick way and have not undergone robust checking as for an Annual Report.

Figures tracking as expected, with approved spending for large project begining to flow through.
We are still waiting on our insurance bill for the year, which has been delayed.

| Account - as at End of Month  | Balance     |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- |
| Operations                    | $  9,362.09 |

Note: The following table was added by Fletcher as a test to see if the information is useful. It deliberately does not include the Infrastructure fund as an allocation. (Harder to calculate)
