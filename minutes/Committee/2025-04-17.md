## Chairperson's Report

While I’ve been overseas recently, it’s been great to see that things have largely continued on as business as usual at the Artifactory. This really speaks to the dedication and effort of our community, especially our volunteers, who keep things ticking along.

That said, it’s worth acknowledging that we are heavily reliant on volunteer availability, and unfortunately that meant we had to pull out of our recent Bunnings community event. It was reported that we were missed, which is a real shame, but hopefully it’s a reminder of how valued our presence is at these types of events.

On a more positive note, the new RSVP system on slack for social events, and open days is a great initiative (cheers Fletcher as always for continuous improvements). Hopefully it helps encourage more people to get involved and makes it easier for us to plan and run events in the future.

Thanks again to everyone who’s been helping out, your support is what keeps this place going.
