## Chairperson's Report

The Artifactory has largely been operating as usual over the past period, with some great contributions from our regular volunteers helping to keep things moving smoothly. 

We’ve recently had some positive engagement with the City of Stirling’s Economic Growth and Development Officers, which has opened the door to some future opportunities. 

Behind the scenes, volunteers have also been busy organising and transporting new tools and equipment acquisitions, as well as to helping to promote the Artifactory off site, such as at regular Bunnings Balcatta events nights. 

However, some key volunteers will be taking some time off, so if any  members have the capacity to lend a hand, whether it’s helping out around the space, assisting with events, or offering your skills in other ways. please reach out to a committee member. Every little bit helps keep the Artifactory train rolling!

Also, just a friendly reminder that it’s only seven weeks until the end of the financial year. If you’re in a position to make a donation for tax deduction purposes, please have a chat with us...we’d be grateful for the support.

Thanks again to all our members and volunteers for being part of this awesome community. Onward!
