### Updating subcommittee expense approvals

See: https://vote.artifactory.org.au/d/6PCqjZga/updating-subcommittee-expense-approvals/1

Amend the [Artifactory Expenses](https://wiki.artifactory.org.au/en/docs/policies/administration#artifactory-expenses) bylaw, to -

* Raise the subcommittee expense authority from $75 (set 10 years ago and never adjusted for inflation) to $150.
* Clarify that it is the chair of a subcommittee (if there is a chair) that has expense authority.
* Allow delegation of the subcommittee expense authority.

Current text:

> * Items for use by a subcommittee of the organisation provided that the total amount is less than $75 and the expense has been approved by the head of the relevant subcommittee.

Proposed text:

> * Items for use by a subcommittee of the organisation provided that a) the total amount is less than $150, and b) the expense has been approved by the chair of the relevant subcommittee or delegated subcommittee member.
>   * Subcommittee chairs and the Management Committee may independently delegate approval authority within the subcommittee, in whatever manner they choose, provided it is documented on the relevant subcommittee page on the wiki.
>   * The Treasurer must be informed in writing regarding all changes to delegated approval authorities.
