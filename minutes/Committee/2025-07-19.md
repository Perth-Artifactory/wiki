## Chairperson's Report

We’re about two months out from the AGM, and unless something totally wild happens, the Artifactory’s rolling into another solid year.

One thing that came up last time was around how decisions get made. While not everyone reads these minutes... anything and everything that can  affect our existing and newmembers goes through the committee. 
Sometimes we don’t all agree, but the end results have always been with the greater good of the space, and our members, in mind.


Also, if you’ve noticed that our website is the best...so have others. We’ve had some great feedback, and if you haven’t had a peek recently, it’s worth a look. Massive thanks to Spondy (Joshua)

### Due invoices

Most of this debt is very stale, and is likely to need to be written off, some will be recouped from bonds.
Debt collection follow up has been effective, as seen by the small amount <30 days overdue (some again is membership period realignment)

Total Overdue - $5,955
>30 days - $4,985
>60 days - $4,565
>120 days - $4,055

### Rehearsal Room Coordinators

* Enquiry Received from "MumBand"

Enquiry received from MumBand (a band consisting of all mums), interested in trialling the rehearsal room once per fortnight.

JC is arranging to have their key access activated, and Lewis will conduct the keyholder induction at a Wed Talkshop (23/7)
A MumBand representative has signed up via TidyHQ. 
JC to follow up post First jam (28/7) and follow up with membership for the subscription date activation and request keybond amount of <???>

There was some pushback from AaronBand regarding their regular Tuesday bookings, following JC's one-off Tuesday booking made two weeks in advance for MumBand. This was addressed in the private Facebook group, where it was clarified that:

o	No band holds entitlement to specific nights,
o	JC had made the booking within the expected time frame,
o	The session was later rescheduled to a Monday night as a courtesy.

MumBand is happy to proceed with Monday night bookings for now but expressed interest in having the flexibility for one Tuesday per month if possible.

JC reiterated to AaronBand that bands should continue to coordinate and self-manage bookings via the usual system.

Monitor how this develops.

* Query from teacher (solo) looking to room booking info

JC advised of subscription fees and link to bookings calender for an insight of available times. offered to give tour if interested. no response
* Wednesday Rehearsal Bookings

Due to feedback from members attending social events and ongoing ArduinoU + Woodworking workshops, JC changed Wednesday Rehearsal Room booking slots from “Reserved for Quiet Bands only” to “Reserved for Artifactory Event” on a recurring basis.
