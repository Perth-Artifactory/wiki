## Treasurer's Report

The Treasurer's Disclaimer: The numbers below have been calculated in a quick way and have not undergone robust checking as for an Annual Report.

Steady income from strong membership numbers this month, high expenses on planned tool and equipment purchases, funded in previous months.
We are in a good position to continue with planned infrastructure projects - Ceiling cladding and Design Lab shelving projects are included in committed funds.

Lewis Yip:
* Anna has expressed interest in stepping up to the committee.
* Since joining six months ago, Anna has consistently put herself forward for higher duties - including giving tours, representing us at events, and being 2nd in command of the space while other volunteers were away.
* Anna has demonstrated calm, level-headed decision making under pressure.
* Anna is already an asset to our community and I believe she will be a worthy addition to the committee.
