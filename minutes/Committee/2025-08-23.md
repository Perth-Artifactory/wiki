## Property Report

Business as usual.

## Chairperson's Report

It’s been largely business as usual around the space, though with a caveat : a few of our key volunteers have been away, which has stretched our capacity for running the Saturday workshops. A huge thanks to those who stepped up to help keep things ticking along, and an especially big shout-out to Lewis Yip, who has taken on the bulk of onboarding new members, training  inductions, whilst also helping us prepare for the upcoming AGM.

Thank you to our newly joined members for their patience with trainings and inductions. As a volunteer only run organisation, these things sometimes take a little longer, and we appreciate your understanding, as we work through your requests.

Looking ahead, our Annual General Meeting will be held on Friday 13 September at 1pm. This is our opportunity to reflect on the past year, plan for the next, and connect as a community.

Please remember: to be eligible to vote you must be a financial member with no outstanding payments when the meeting starts. Please Take a moment to check your membership status now, so your voting rights are secure.

Thanks again to everyone for your support and contributions. I’m looking forward to seeing many of you at the AGM and around the workshop.

## Treasurer's Report

The Treasurer's Disclaimer: The numbers below have been calculated in a quick way and have not undergone robust checking as for an Annual Report.

Steady income from strong membership numbers this month, high expenses on planned tool and equipment purchases, funded in previous months.
We are in a good position to continue with planned infrastructure projects - Ceiling cladding and Design Lab shelving projects are included in committed funds.

## Subcommittee Reports

Updates from subcommittees - discussions or requests for action.

### Laser Subcommittee

* Laser training
  * Lots of people doing laser training - stretching trainer availability to the limit (see discussion under General Hacking Saturdays - below)
  * Need to bring on more trainers.
  * Multiple trainees have failed their Part 2 assessments in the last month (about a 1/3rd fail rate). This is both good (it means the assessment process is rigorous) and bad (disappointing for the trainee).

### IT Subcommittee

* We saw unexpected usage of one of our external services (Shlink, url shortener)
  * Issue has been mitigated

### Promotions Subcommittee

* Upcoming Pride Fair Stall : JC to work with Renee and Penny to organise promo

### Associate Memberships Panel

### Infrastructure Subcommittee

* Wood delivered, thanks to John next door.
* Fridge/freezer donated - thank you Brett for the donation, Alec + Dad for transporting it, and Anna for coordinating!
* Ceiling cladding preparation has commenced, second work session planned for Sunday. Likely more work than anticipated.
* Design lab shelving project to commence Sunday
* New shelving for electronics parts has been donated, migration will also begin Sunday
* Wood zone has been rearranged again, goal is to reduce the height of the stuff in front of the rehearsal room window since it's going to be opened up

    * Keeping up with 3D printer and CNC router training requests (different pool of trainers).

### Appoint Anna Whitlock to the committee

Lewis Yip:
* Anna has expressed interest in stepping up to the committee.
* Since joining six months ago, Anna has consistently put herself forward for higher duties - including giving tours, representing us at events, and being 2nd in command of the space while other volunteers were away.
* Anna has demonstrated calm, level-headed decision making under pressure.
* Anna is already an asset to our community and I believe she will be a worthy addition to the committee.

### Appoint Lewis Peaty to the committee

Lewis Yip:
* Lewis Peaty has expressed interest in stepping up to the committee.
* Since joining ~12 months ago, Lewis Peaty has consistently put himself forward for higher duties - including giving tours, writing training documents / operating procedures (dry oven), and helping with infrastructure projects (dry oven, kiln).
* Lewis Peaty is already an asset to our community and I believe he will be a worthy addition to the committee.
* 📈 *This will put us on track to be a 100% Lewis committee by 2050.*

### CROC

Clarify what sponsorship arrangements we have with CROC so all committee members are on the same page.

* Work on this post AGM.

### Bunnings BBQ

Bunnings have given us a prize, where they will supply the drinks for us to sell. This will greatly increase our fundraising potential on the day

The date has been organised for Sunday 2nd November. Expense authorisation will go through Loomio closer to the day.

Renae has organised for experienced friends to help prepare for, and run the day. Penny also has experience with running these.

Ideally we will have enough volunteers to run an Artifactory sales/promo table alongside the BBQ. 

### Pride Fairday

We have applied to have another stall at pride Fairday, after our success last year. 

Date is Sunday 23rd November. Penny and Renae will take lead on organising. Expense authority request and callout for volunteers will be done closer to the event.

Slack channel event_pride-fairday-stall already resurrected from last year.

* Idea to run a "Pride open day" the Sunday after Pride Fairday.

### Pride month workshop

Penny and Renae intend to offer a half day workshop to allow participants to build a spice rack from reclaimed materials. This will be similar to the event run in December with Alice for Penny's staff party. 

This will be advertised as part of Pride month, we will be able to sell tickets through TidyHQ. 

Expense authority request will be done closer to the event. 

Slack Channel event_pride-woodwork-workshop is already live, volunteers will be added as they are confirmed, committee members welcome to join.

* Pushed back - to next year.
