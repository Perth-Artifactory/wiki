### Due invoices

This figure is inflated as we are in the middle of merging membership invoicing groups, so member's due dates are different, but there has been no formal communication as of yet.
We will not chase these for now as long as they are making regular payments

Total Overdue - $8,310
Under 30 Days - $4,050
Over 120 Days - $2.965
