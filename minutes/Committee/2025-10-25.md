## Incident Reports

* A former member posted in Slack asking for general members to supervise them while using the space's 3D printers and laser cutters.
  * The former member's permission to use these tools had previously been revoked due to using the tools unsafely. This was not mentioned in the former member's post.
  * A committee member clarified in public messages that only tool trainers can supervise the use of tools.
  * A committee member direct messaged the former member, pointing out that the request in Slack was misleading because it didn't indicate the true reasons why the former member needed supervision.
* (Continuing from previous month) - RE: A member left the space abruptly during laser cutting
  * A laser trainer had a second laser training session with the member.
  * During the training session, the trainer raised concerns around the member's previous behaviour.
  * The member does not agree with the sequence of events.
  * Two committee members discussed this issue with the member and agreed on a staged approach to training and assessment which may better accomodate the member's circumstances.
  * The discussion was focused on the member's pathway to laser use, and did not touch on the issue of the member's behavior.
  * ACTION: Loomio / slack discussion on further actions.

## Property Report

* Nothing to report.

## Chairperson's Report

* Thank you to everyone that worked on our action items from the last meeting etc, good to see progress on some of our older oustanding topics.

## Treasurer's Report

We have has high expenses during the month of September, exceeding our income by almost $5,000. This is a significant proportion of the funds available at this time outside our reserve. Money will need to be moved from the secure account to pay October rent.

The money was mainly spent to enhance the range of activities that can be supported in the space. This includes $1,513 for welding gas and cylinders, $556.85 for transport and mobile base for our large new jointer, $336 for a battery spot welder, and $200 for an Arbortech wood carver. There was also a significant bar restock ($1,090), a promotional stall for Pride Fairday - ($1,000) a cordless vacuum for the space ($229) and $370 for food for the AGM attendees.

While these are generally planned and budgeted expenses, this level of spending will not be expected to continue. Committee members will need to be mindful that our funds are spent intentionally, and a reserve of is recommended to be agreed upon and maintained.

I have raised a separate item to review and clarify subcommittee spending and Treasurer aporoval authority in other business.

### Due invoices

Figures in TidyHQ currently meaningless due to errors in invoice creation and significant stale debt with no chance of payment.

I have been working through the stale debt with Lewis Peaty and Anna, and Fletcher and I have discussed training them to assist with management officer tasks.

### Subcommittee Spending and Treasurer approvals

As mentioned in the Treasurer's report, there has been significant expenditure by subcommittee chairs which was not approved elsewhere.

September:
IT Subcommittee - $687.52 (Workshop Speakers, HUD Screen, Design Lab Charging Station, Replacement system for charging phones near social table )
Infrastructure Subcommittee $208.04 (Workshop Speakers,Bag Shelving, BBQ Covers)
3D Printer Subcommittee - $122.44 (Printer Beds, Subscription)
Laser Subcommittee - $54.54 (Probe)
Promotions Subcommittee - $5.04 (Rope)

Each transaction was individually under $150 (or split between sub-committes) I want to clarify the scope and intention of the committee in delegating the expenditure authority, and the expectations around reporting. 

In my opinion, all of the expenses were appropriate and added value to the space, my query is around the extent to which the committee want to be involved and/or informed.

My thoughts are that any project or item total exceeding $50 should be included in the relevant monthly subcommittee report to the committee.

I would like clarity on committee preferences as to what should be approved by the treasurer vs deferred to committee meeting.
