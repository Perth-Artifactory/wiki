## Treasurer's Report

We have has high expenses during the month of September, exceeding our income by almost $5,000. This is a significant proportion of the funds available at this time outside our reserve. Money will need to be moved from the secure account to pay October rent.
The money was mainly spent to enhance the range of activities than can be supported in the space. This includes $1,513 for welding gas and cylinders, $556.85 for transport and mobile base for our large new jointer, $336 for a battery spot welder, and $200 for an Arbortech wood carver. There was also a significant bar restock ($1,090), a promotional stall for Pride Fairday - ($1,000) a cordless vacuum for the space ($229) and $370 for food for the AGM attendees.

While these are generally planned and budgeted expenses, this level of spending will not be expected to continue. Committee members will need to be mindful that our funds are spent intentionally, and a reserve of is recommended to be agreed upon and maintained.

I have raised a separate item to review and clarify subcommittee spending authority in other business.

#### Deferred Authorisations:

As quite significant amounts have been spent by Sub-committes without full committe authorisation this month, a number of expenses have been deferred to the full committee below. This includes three larger projects - Workshop Speakers ($310.80) and two charging stations ($241.08) which I do not believe are  appropriate to undertake without discussion with committee. Separate item below.

| 02/09/2025 | $160.00 | Altronics | Charger,Speakers | Equipment Purchases/Sales  |
| 02/09/2025 | $118.50 | Altronics | Speaker Hookups  | Infrastructure - Expenses  |

The following were errors which have been repaid. I paid myself in error instead of Sophie, and Fletcher's Artifactory card was incorrectly used at Altronics for a personal purchase for Ilke.

### Due invoices

Figures in TidyHQ currently meaningless due to errors in invoice creation and significant stale debt with no chance of payment.
I have been working through the stale debt with Peaty and Anna, and Fletcher and I have discussed training them to assist with management officer tasks.
Motion under Membership report to write off a number of unrecoverable debts

Bayswater Women’s Workshop visit (Renae)

6 members of Bayswater Womens Workshop attended to prepare materials for their future courses. Hosted by Ren, Fletcher, Anna and Penny. 
Very positive morning, attendees had a great time and want to collaborate more in future. 
BWW paid the casual attendees cost for attendees and paid for our volunteer lunches.
There is potential for them to apply for grants to pay for combined events in future.

### Subcommittee Spending

As mentioned in the Treasurer's report, there has been significant expenditure by subcommittee chairs which was not approved elsewhere.

September:
IT Subcommittee - $687.52 (Workshop Speakers, HUD Screen, 2 Charging Stations)
Infrastructure Subcommittee $208.04 (Workshop Speakers,Bag Shelving, BBQ Covers)
3D Printer Subcommittee - $122.44 (Printer Beds, Subscription)
Laser Subcommittee - $54.54 (Probe)
Promotions Subcommittee - $5.04

While each transaction was individually under $150 (or split between sub-committes), I do not feel this was the intention of the committee in delegating the expenditure authority. My preference is strongly for the full committee to be kept informed about projects undertaken by subcommittees, and the expenses these projects are incurring. 

My proposal is to clarify that the Subcommittee delegated expense authority is for a total of $150 per calendar month, and that any project or item total exceeding $50 should be included in the relevant monthly subcommittee report to the committee.
