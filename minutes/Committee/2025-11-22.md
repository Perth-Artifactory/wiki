  * Have met with the member to discuss.
  * Refer [Loomio thread for outcomes of discussion](https://vote.artifactory.org.au/d/TkjVZGKI/8/).
  * No further action required at this time.

## Property Report

* PROPERTY

## Chairperson's Report

* Great to see use of the token system is accelerating.
* We definitely need to continue to focus on the first stage of the membership funnel, the latter stages seem to be running smoothly.

## Treasurer's Report

The Treasurer's Disclaimer: The numbers below have been calculated in a quick way and have not undergone robust checking as for an Annual Report.

Our costs have gone up as a result of a CPI increase to our lease. This does not require any immediate changes to our way of operating, but it does eat up some of the comfort buffer we had. Continuing to be mindful of expenditure, and ensuring membership invoices are paid regularly will suffice for now.

Motion: Appoint Lewis Peaty as Deputy Treasurer. Assistance has been invaluable.

### Quartermasters

* Stock is largely running okay, had a minor stock issue with Costco that we'll hopefully resolve next week.

### Membership Officers

* Somewhat large (6) person member induction last week, there'll be a little bit of a strain on the rest of the membership pipeline as they acclimatise

### Membership Storage Officer

## Subcommittee Reports

Updates from subcommittees - discussions or requests for action.

### Laser Subcommittee

* Training requests in our area are being met in a timely fashion
* 3 new faces at maintenance, productive evening
* Found an issue with Big Red's head
  * Causing alignment issues that means we burn through lenses faster and maintenance takes more time
  * Replacement head is around $100, ordering

### IT Subcommittee

* Work on the design HUD continues, most functionality is there and the system is in use
  * Feedback has been positive
  * Should we introduce the same system to other areas of the space? (eg, machine room)
* General improvements to Training Tracker, Volunteer Tokens, and Pledge Bot were completed
  * Interfaces should be a bit more responsive (less affected by TidyHQ being slow)
* Work on a member portal has begun

### Promotions Subcommittee

#### Bunnings BBQ Report

Bunnings BBQ went really well.
- Thank you to all volunteers, especially Aaron Mathews and Kira Sparrow who did all the prep for the day.
- Very smoothly run.
- Did not get the number of volunteers hoped for, but had significant contributions from a number of legends.

Total of 13 volunteers.
- 8 Artifactory members
- 2 from Bayswater Women's Shed
- 3 of Renae's friends volunteered on the day.
- Would need more people willing to help to agree to take this on again.
