### Documents Executed

* Nil

## Incident Reports

* Nil

## Property Report

* Will look at filling in some of the potholes in the carpark.

## Chairperson's Report

* Morale in the space appears to be high, things are running (mostly) smoothly :)

## Treasurer's Report

The Treasurer's Disclaimer: The numbers below have been calculated in a quick way and have not undergone robust checking as for an Annual Report.

A very positive month overall, mainly due to 2 large fundraising efforts. Thank you to all members and friends of the space who made this happen.

Membership income report is high this month, due to paying off historical unpaid membership invoices from bonds held.

Talkshop income report is low, showing an almost $500 loss. This is likely partially due to receipts no longer automatically printing, although the income from drinks is not up at all.

Suggest resetting printer to automatically print receipts either on food days, or permanently.

Closer scrutiny of expenses and payments will be needed if this is repeated next month.

New reporting format of income/expenditure trialled as requested last month.

* PDF format of the same info below, tabled via Slack, for easier reading during the meeting.

## Subcommittee Reports

Updates from subcommittees - discussions or requests for action.

### Laser Subcommittee

* Had 2 days of downtime for one laser cutter
* Training being met in a timely fashion

### IT Subcommittee

* More time has been spent onboarding Tom on internal setups
* We had a short outage of Loomio which was resolved in a timely fashion 
* Migration work on Training Tracker, Pledges, Volunteer tokens is almost complete
  * Training:
    * Browsing your own inductions is more responsive
    * We've added a feature that allows signed off users to view relevant induction material if present
    * Exploring sign offs across the workshop is more responsive
    * Support has been added for QR codes that when scanned indicate whether the scanner has the relevant sign off for a particular tool. Intention is to redo "You must be Artifactory trained to use this tool" badges
  * Pledges:
    * Easier to browse, create projects for users
    * Donating is no longer tied to a Slack account (still requires TidyHQ for billing right now)
    * UI has been revamped to celebrate the viewers contributions to projects as well as how quickly a project met the funding goal
  * Volunteer tokens:
    * Better insight into volunteering areas
    * Approval system for tokens that allows for self submission
    * Granulated token classification system
    * Better stats for individuals

### Promotions Subcommittee

* Bunnings BBQ - 
  * Successful fundraiser - almost $3,000 profit. Relied too heavily on a few key volunteers and external (non Artifactory) volunteers. Not enough support from Artifactory members to repeat unless fundraising for a particular project.
  * Useful exposure from promotional standpoint.

* Pride Fairday
  * Great promotional event - talked to a lot of people, some who would make great additions to our community.
  * Larger marquee and power for 3D printers was nice. Extra space made it much easier to talk to the right people about the space.
  * Good volunteer buy-in, particularly with help to transport items back and forth.
  * Took in $1,100, costs were around the same. Good opportunity to promote the space in a low cost way.
  
* Bunnings Xmas Family night
  * Ran smoothly
  * Thank you to David, Calum, Max for joining us for the first time :)
  * ~$200 (including $100 Bunnings credit)

### Associate Memberships Panel

One application received - Studying in NSW, wants sponsorship for 4 people to use 3D printers and laser while in Perth for 2 months 

- Panel has decided to reject this application.

### Infrastructure Subcommittee

* Started work on a swappable social table
  * Had a couple of setbacks, hoping to have the piece finished by NYE
* Craft room is ready for budget submission for the first round of changes (will be on Loomio soon)
* Various minor usability improvements across the workshop (like the machine room door)
* Training requests are being met in a timely fashion

### 3D Printers Subcommittee

* A couple of printers were taken offline this month and were subsequently repaired
  * Very little member impact, other printers took up the slack
* Training requests are being met though our backstop (Fletcher) is being used more often for initial training than is ideal

## Loomio Review

* Review outstanding Loomio threads

## Subcommittee bylaw revision

The [Artifactory Expenses](/docs/policies/administration#artifactory-expenses) bylaw, as amended 2025-06-16, states that:

> The Treasurer is authorised to reimburse/pay for the following expenses without seeking committee approval. The Treasurer may refer a particular payment to the Management Committee for approval at their discretion.
> * **Items for use by a subcommittee of the organisation** provided that a) the total amount is less than $150, and b) the expense has been approved by **the chair of the relevant subcommittee** or delegated subcommittee member.
>   * Subcommittee chairs and the Management Committee may independently delegate approval authority within the subcommittee, in whatever manner they choose, provided it is documented on the relevant subcommittee page on the wiki.
>   * Delegated authority may be limited to specific purposes or limits as specified in the delegation.
>   * The Treasurer must be informed in writing regarding all changes to delegated approval authorities.
{.is-info}

There is a gap here because not all subcommittees have chairpersons, and there is no defined procedure to appoint chairpersons.

To address this, Lewis Yip proposes to amend the Subcommittees bylaw by adding the **text in bold** below.

> ## Membership of subcommittee
>
> A subcommittee ---
>
> * must have at least two members.
> * must include at least one committee member.
> * **must have a chairperson.**
> * may include any person the committee considers appropriate, whether the person is a member or not.
>
> A person may be appointed to, or removed from, a subcommittee ---
>
> * By the committee; or
> * By the subcommittee, subject to approval by the committee.
>
> **A person may be appointed as the chairperson of a subcommittee ---**
> * **By the committee; or**
> * **By the subcommittee, subject to approval by the committee.**
> 
> 
> **Note: The chairperson of a subcommittee has expense approval authority as defined in the Artifactory Expenses bylaw.**

We then need to appoint chairpersons for any subcommittee that doesn't already have a chairperson.

| Subcommittee | Current chairperson | Comments |
| - | - | - |
| Infrastructure | Joshua Rospondek | OK |
| Laser | Blake Samuels | OK |
| Associate Memberships Panel | None | Ben, JC, Renae. Renae will discuss internally and raise on Loomio |
| IT Subcommittee | None | Nick, Blake, Fletcher, Tom White. Propose to appoint Fletcher Boyd. |
| 3D Printers | Fletcher Boyd | Propose to switch to Tom White |
| Promotions | None | Penny, JC, Tegan. Propose to appoint JC. |
