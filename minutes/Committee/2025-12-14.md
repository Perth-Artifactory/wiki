## Treasurer's Report

The Treasurer's Disclaimer: The numbers below have been calculated in a quick way and have not undergone robust checking as for an Annual Report.

A very positive month overall, mainly due to 2 large fundraising efforts. Thank you to all members and friends of the space who made this happen.
Membership income report is high this month, due to paying off historical unpaid membership invoices from bonds held.
Talkshop income report is low, showing an almost $500 loss. This is likely partially due to receipts no longer automatically printing, although the income from drinks is not up at all.
Suggest resetting printer to automatically print receipts either on food days, or permanently.
Closer scrutiny of expenses and payments will be needed if this is repeated next month

New reporting format of income/expenditure trialled as requested last month.

### Promotions Subcommittee
* Bunnings BBQ - 
  * Successful fundraiser - almost $3,000 profit. Relied too heavily on a few key volunteers. Not enough support from members to repeat unless fundraising for a particular project. 
  * Useful exposure from promotional standpoint

* Pride Fairday
  * Great promotional event - talked to a lot of people, some who would make great additions to our community.
  * Larger marquee and power for 3d printers was nice. Extra space made it much easier to talk to the right people about the space.
  * Good volunteer buy-in, particularly with help to transport items back and forth.
  * Took in $1,100, costs were arond the same. Good opportunity to promiote the space in a low cost way.
  
* Bunnings Xmas Family night

### Associate Memberships Panel

One application received - Studying in NSW, wants sponsorship for 4 people to use 3D printers and laser while in Perth for 2 months 
While the panel is set up to "Act as the sole selection/approval panel for all associate class memberships unless otherwise delegated" it seems appropriate to open this up to feedback from full committee, as there will be a signigicant training impost on people outside the panel (lasers, 3d printers)
The panel is split: 1 for, 2 against. email sent to Fletcher and Lewis to provide feedback.
Panel will consider this info when making a decision.

## Loomio Review

* Review outstanding Loomio threads

## Subcommittee bylaw revision

The [Artifactory Expenses](/docs/policies/administration#artifactory-expenses) bylaw, as amended 2025-06-16, states that:

> The Treasurer is authorised to reimburse/pay for the following expenses without seeking committee approval. The Treasurer may refer a particular payment to the Management Committee for approval at their discretion.
> * **Items for use by a subcommittee of the organisation** provided that a) the total amount is less than $150, and b) the expense has been approved by **the chair of the relevant subcommittee** or delegated subcommittee member.
>   * Subcommittee chairs and the Management Committee may independently delegate approval authority within the subcommittee, in whatever manner they choose, provided it is documented on the relevant subcommittee page on the wiki.
>   * Delegated authority may be limited to specific purposes or limits as specified in the delegation.
>   * The Treasurer must be informed in writing regarding all changes to delegated approval authorities.
{.is-info}

There is a gap here because not all subcommittees have chairpersons, and there is no defined procedure to appoint chairpersons.

To address this, Lewis Yip proposes to amend the Subcommittees bylaw by adding the **text in bold** below.

> ## Membership of subcommittee
>
> A subcommittee ---
>
> * must have at least two members.
> * must include at least one committee member.
> * **must have a chairperson.**
> * may include any person the committee considers appropriate, whether the person is a member or not.
>
> A person may be appointed to, or removed from, a subcommittee ---
>
> * By the committee; or
> * By the subcommittee, subject to approval by the committee.
>
> **A person may be appointed as the chairperson of a subcommittee ---**
> * **By the committee; or**
> * **By the subcommittee, subject to approval by the committee.**
> 
> 
> **Note: The chairperson of a subcommittee has expense approval authority as defined in the Artifactory Expenses bylaw.**

We then need to appoint chairpersons for any subcommittee that doesn't already have a chairperson.

| Subcommittee | Current chairperson | Comments |
| - | - | - |
| Infrastructure | Joshua Rospondek | OK |
| Laser | Blake Samuels | OK |
| Associate Memberships Panel | None | Ben, JC, Renae. Propose to appoint Ben Connor |
| IT Subcommittee | None | Nick, Blake, Fletcher, Tom White. Propose to appoint Tom White. |
| 3D Printers | Fletcher Boyd | OK |
| Promotions | None | Penny, JC, Tegan. Propose to appoint JC. |
