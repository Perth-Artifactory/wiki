### Documents Executed

Nil.

## Incident Reports

* Equipment left completely not cleaned up/packed away by a member
  * Addressed as a conduct warning (Anna/Renae), was resolved amicably
* Compound saw damaged due to improper use
  * Demonstrably went against our operation guidelines
  * Addressed as a conduct warning (Renae/Fletcher), was resolved amicably and the member is replacing the damaged component
* Small wood lathe tipped over being moved in courtyard
   * Bruising, no first aid needed.
   * Person did not pay sufficient attention to the fact that it had been left in an unstable position mid move.
   * trolley is somewhat unstable due to having only 3 wheels (as originally recieved)
   * potentially swap over to other lathe trolley. 
* Returning member not aware of current tool induction procedure and started using yellow tools.
  * We had attempted to reach out but couldn't get in touch using their previous contact method.
  * Noticed when Renae noticed them using a tool inappropriately.
  * They have been asked to attend a new member induction to get up to speed with new procedures.


## Property Report

* Nothing to report

## Chairperson's Report

* Volunteer contributions to the space dropped in December (as expected with the holidays) but we're on track for January to see similar numbers to November. As adoption of the new system increases I expect to see this number increase closer to what I suspect are the actual numbers.
* The volunteer hours being spent on Member Portal development are having a noticeable negative impact on other areas of the space, notably infrastructure projects.
  * My hope is that the long term decrease in administrative volunteer hours will offset this impact and allow our volunteers to do more enjoyable things in the space. (e.g. automated reconciliation and event billing)

## Treasurer's Report

The Treasurer's Disclaimer: The numbers below have been calculated in a quick way and have not undergone robust checking as for an Annual Report.

Our costs continue to be met, as membership numbers stay strong. $5,000 drawn down last year moved back to secure account thanks to fundraising efforts.

Overdue invoices report done, with current members with overdue invoices all contacted last week. Fletcher has list to go through resigned members.

Issue with insufficient social food payments resolved this month. Thank you to everyone who helped with nudging or passing terminal around.

Costs in general are going to continue to rise. We haven't raised our membership fees since 2014. We might want to start proactively considering options to ensure we stay in a sustainable financial position.

* Discussion:
  * Consider keeping existing members on legacy pricing provided they maintain continuity of membership.
  * To raise for input from our members at AGM.

Reports to be emailed in for review of committee when officer does not attend meeting.

### Event Officer

* Nothing to report

### Quartermasters

* Infra proposed vending revamp will make restocking easier

### Membership Officers

* Several suggested keyholder motions:

| Motion Text | Moved by    | Seconded by       | Status            |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Offer 24/7 key to Cherie Giffard | Renae       | Fletcher          | Accepted |


| Motion Text | Moved by    | Seconded by       | Status            |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Offer 24/7 key to Alexiea Li | Fletcher       | Renae          | Accepted |

* Fletcher - ACTION - Process Cherie Giffard key application
* Fletcher - ACTION - Process Alexiea Li key application
* Lewis Yip - ACTION - Amend keyholder induction to include: require keyholders to run visitor inductions / visitor signup process, for people they bring into the space.

### Membership Storage Officer

* New tools for lockers complete, will onboard Lewis Peaty (Fletcher)

## Subcommittee Reports

Updates from subcommittees - discussions or requests for action.

### Laser Subcommittee

* Several outages over the month, resolved as they arose.
  * Not specific to member operation, just older machine
* We haven't fitted the new head yet
* Plans to clean the laser beds are taking shape
  * Lewis/Anna/Fletcher are workshopping a plan

### IT Subcommittee

* We've spun up a self hosted [git instance](https://git.artifactory.org.au) to make bug reporting easier (since it authenticates through the portal)
* Several workstation monitors have been upgraded, they now also support laptops (Thank you donors!)
* Left hand workstation upgraded (Thank you donor!)
* Ongoing issue with some automation buttons, we're still investigating
* #announcements and #training-and-inductions now have their direct channel messages moderated to committee and trainers respectively.
  * Doesn't work for threaded replies being shared to channel (yet)

#### Member portal

* Some of our older systems have been migrated
  * In function: Training, Pledges, RSVPs (in progress), File Butler, Some Taiga forms
  * Login: Wiki, Nextcloud
  * Notifications are handled through the portal as well, feedback has been positive so far (admittedly from our tech focused members)
* Changelogs for the portal can be found [here](https://git.artifactory.org.au/Perth-Artifactory/member_portal/releases)
* We have a desktop application for our workstations to help users manage their member work folders and (potentially) Chrome sessions.
* Bug reports (from others) are typically being solved within 24h, feature requests within 72h-ish

#### Alternatives

* Given the time being invested in development it's prudent to explore other options. (none of these prices include card processing fees for payments)
  * Member Matters (Self hosted, Open source) - Last commit to `main` was 10 months ago. We'd have to fork the project as PRs don't seem to be getting merged.
  * TidyHQ ($890/yr) - Missing most of the features we need (current)
  * Spacebring ($4,692/yr)
  * Omnify ($3,144/yr may be USD)
  * Fabman ($2,059/yr)
  * Coworks ($2,988/yr may be in USD)

#### Xero migration

* A current Xero promotion has dropped our dual subscription cost (the period where we need to pay for both TidyHQ and Xero) by 90%
* We'll be slowly migrating finance data from TidyHQ. Biggest motivator is bank feeds that will allow for automated reconciliation
* Migration will be idempotent (essentially repeatable) so we don't need to pull the trigger immediately

### Promotions Subcommittee

* Cherie has been onboarded to social media manager and it seems to be going very well.
* Fletcher has been assisting with reviewing posts / videos prior to public release.

### Associate Memberships Panel

No applications 

### Infrastructure Subcommittee

* Feast table project has hit a roadblock
  * Call has been made to not throw good wood after bad, and rethink the underlying design
* Craft room needs a push
  * Cost saving measures exist (e.g. replacing some of the material with chipboard) but has a time cost
  * Fletcher - ACTION - Follow up with Ben regarding help for the craft room.
  * General vibe seems to be that having the reduced noise from rehearsals is still a net positive regardless
  * Kamil has made progress on the large sewing machine
* It may be time to call it on the vending machine
  * Proposed next steps (pressurising and leak testing) are not an easy skillset to come by in our current membership. Likely looking at a $1k cost to _maybe_ fix the issue.
  * While we didn't have a use for the space it was fine for the vending machine to sit there.
  * There's an alternative proposal for the space now.
  * We consulted with Penny (who has the most time invested in the vending machine) before proposing the change.
* Consumable sales/drink storage revamp
  * We could replace the vending machine with a garage rack for drinks and a hinged panel that had drawers mounted on it for consumable sale items
  * More room to sell consumables
  * Restocking is easier - less awkward manual handling
  * Looks nicer than the vending machine
* Hot works
  * Oxy/acetylene is operational
    * Opening up test training to active members (ie whoever happens to be around when it's not hot) to test teaching material
  * A larger anvil has been donated
  * May have a new welding trainer
    * Boilermaker by trade
    * Doesn't have much training experience - this is largely a teachable skill
    * Fletcher will continue to deliver the safety part of welding training, to meet our training level obligations
* Electronics shelving revamp continues
  * Plan for the next stage is:
    * Put the new drawers in the room temporarily
    * Sort things into the drawers
    * Remove the new drawers
    * Rebuild the bench with the new drawers in mind
    * Put everything back together
  * This currently requires very little direct infrastructure work, sorting will be handled by electronics users. (Steve, Sophie, Tom, Andy etc)
* Dust extractor - bag has split, needs to be changed. Spare bag is available.

### Curtin Design Club (CDC)

Anna, Lewis, and Fletcher met Hieu and Aiden from the Curtin Design Club on 2026-01-10.

This was a good meeting. Hieu and Aiden were good to deal with.

There is an email chain in the committee inbox (ref: "Curtin Design Club Sponsorship Opportunity") for full details.

To summarise:

* Curtin Design Club is a relatively new club including all types of design (e.g. graphic design, product design)
* What they want from us, is to help expose their members to physical making processes and projects.
* What we want from them, is a pipeline of potential future members.
* We spent quite a bit of time explaining how we work as an organisation (full volunteer charity, etc), what our limitations are (we're all volunteers), and what they can reasonably expect from us.

What we have offered is:

> Sponsorship - the things we can offer you include:
> * Instructional / demonstration sessions on physical making skills that align with your members' interests. (More discussion on that below.)
> * Sponsored memberships as prizes - typically for people who have demonstrated they will make good use of our facilities (i.e. not selected by random chance)
> * Discounted tool usage fees for projects of the Design Club itself (e.g. making demonstration pieces, making kits for club use, etc)
> * Opening the workshop for use by your members outside of normal event times (e.g. in the week before a laser cutting assignment is due.)

Regarding the "instructional / demonstration sessions..." we have proposed some sessions on laser cutting and 3D printing.
* These would be similar in scope to a "Showcase Saturday", or the soldering workshops we have previously run for CRoC.
* Lewis and Fletcher are comfortable to backstop the delivery of these sessions if required.

CDC's committee has discussed the above and would like to proceed. They propose running the first workshop event in July.

Discussion:
* Lewis Yip:
  * This seems like a good deal for us.
  * The workshop sessions are similar to what we would run as a "Showcase Saturday" (so the course material is reusable for our own internal events.)
  * We aren't being asked for a huge amount of time or effort.
  * We aren't proposing to let CDC members have general access to the workshop, so we won't have the same sort of policy compliance/tool damage risks that we have had with CRoC last year.
  * Any CDC members who come on board as sponsored memberships will be subject to our full onboarding (inductions, tool training) process.
  * I recommend that we proceed.


### Curtin Robotics Club (CRoC)

We recieved the following from Silas Butler on 2026-01-06.

> Hi Artifactory Committee,
>
> We're beginning to do our sponsorship rounds and wanted to confirm whether the Artifactory would be keen to continue to sponsor CRoC going into 2026. The Artifactory has been a long standing supporter of our club, helping get events like our Hackathon off the ground as well as lending their time and expertise. 
>
> If you would be keen on continuing to sponsor us, I think it would be good to rehash some of the details with our new executive team, to provide clarity on the terms of the sponsorship that may not have been written down.
>
> Kind Regards,
>
> Silas Butler
> Executive Committee - Secretary

We need to decide:

* Is our relationship with CRoC worth continuing?
* If so, what is each side offering?

Previously, we had offered some combination of:

* Sponsored membership for selected CRoC representatives
* Access to tools and training
* Discounted or waived tool usage fees for CROC projects
* Time and attention of our volunteers to facilitate use of the workshop and tools, outside regular opening hours

The benefits we obtained were:

* Advertising the Artifactory within the Curtin community
* Personal satisfaction of members interested in CRoC's success
* Association with CRoC's good works (e.g. teaching 3D printing to PNG teachers.)

The costs and risks we incurred were:

* The time and attention of our volunteers
* Damage to multiple expensive tools (IR reflow oven and 3D scanner) that seem to be associated with CRoC member usage (and which were not reported by the user at the time) - unresolved.
* Poor compliance with induction procedures (e.g. visitor induction, visitor signup / indemnity waiver) that exposed us to risk.
* Poor oversight of CRoC users in the workshop generally.

Discussion:
* Lewis Yip:
  * I wasn't directly involved with CRoC so happy to be corrected on anything below.
  * I think our experience with CRoC last year (and with uni students generally) is that they have less experience and ability to make good decisions than our general members.
  * They are interested in achieving their goals, but not really interested in becoming members, sustaining the space, engaging with our processes, or treating our tools nicely.
  * The nature of what CRoC wants from us (intensive use of our workshop and our high end, expensive tools for their club projects) needs a lot of volunteer effort to manage appropriately.
  * Simultaneously, our volunteers who assist with CRoC are not necessarily equipped to play "bad cop" and enforce our policies and procedures, especially when there are multiple CRoC people and only one volunteer.
  * If we do engage with CRoC again, I think we need to control their use of the space much more tightly, to prevent further tool damage and risk exposure.
  
Lewis Yip - ACTION - Advise CROC that we will not be continuing sponsorship this year.

### External sales

* White Dwarf Books - 3D printed toys
  * Has been up for ~ 1 month now.
  * Total revenue - $155 - mostly one large purchase (by an employee).
