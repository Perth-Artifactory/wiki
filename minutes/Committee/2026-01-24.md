## Treasurer's Report

The Treasurer's Disclaimer: The numbers below have been calculated in a quick way and have not undergone robust checking as for an Annual Report.

Our costs continue to be met, as membership numbers stay strong.

Overdue invoices report done, with current members with overdue invoices all contacted last week. Fletcher has list to go through resigned members.

Issue with insufficient social food payments resolved this month. Thank you to everyone who helped with nudging or passing terminal around.

Internet costs - Aussie Broadband going up from $86 to $105 per month. Costs in general are going to continue to rise. We haven't raised our membership fees since 2014. We might want to start proactively considering options to ensure we stay in a sustainable financial position.
