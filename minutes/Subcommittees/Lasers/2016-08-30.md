##### Laser subcommittee meeting 2016-08-30

Present: Nick, Mitch, Steve

Very short (1 minute) catchup before NoizeMaschin!

-   150W laser tube probably in Australia. Mitch to bring to the space and advise other members of the committee when it is here.
-   Raspberry Pi still failed. Big Red is currently unswipeable with no ETA to fix.
