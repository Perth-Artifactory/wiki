-   New 1 GaAs lens (thanks Steve!)
-   7 new mirrors have arrived:
    -   3 \* Si, matte one side, with gold-coloured reflective surface coating
        -   Less dense, higher specific heat but lower total thermal mass, appropriate for small to medium power (fine for us at 130W!), possibly less durable?

    -   4 \* Mo metal, probably uncoated on reflective surface

-   LC1290 alignment
    -   Aspect ratio check: good
        -   Configured AxisOnePulseMoveLength is same for X and Y
        -   Y is good, well within 1%
        -   X is adequate, compressed by a small factor, approaching 1%
    -   Bed level check: Poor, out of focus on LHS
        -   Cuts 50mm/sec on right, 30mm/sec or worse on left
        -   Replace original metal final mirror - clean, with small centre blemish
            -   Fresh coated Si mirror, now cutting at 55mm/sec on right
        -   Clean chaff and level bed
            -   Now consistent: cutting 3mm MDF at 55mm/second
