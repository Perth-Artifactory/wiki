# Laser Subcommittee Meeting 2018-06-04

Attendees:

-   Blake, Nick

Notes:

-   Little red
    -   Cutting fine at around 12mm/s for 3mm MDF
    -   Tube change being pursued
        -   Require end extension
        -   Require tube mounts
-   Big red
    -   Was cutting badly \<40mm/s for 3mm MDF
        -   Tried head heights from 18mm to 22mm and at no height did it cut well
        -   Focus looked bad
    -   Inspected lens and found it dirty
    -   Cleaning lens has helped
    -   Drawing about 31mA when cutting
        -   Too high - our limit is 26mA
        -   Max power was set 85%. Reduced to 65% and saved and downloaded.
        -   Also had to redownload job to get new max power to be effective
        -   Back to 25mA now
    -   After cleaning lens, cut speed slowed after several cuts
    -   Replaced lens and found that improved things
    -   Optimal nozzle to material height between 19mm and 20mm. Offset set to 14mm to achieve this by z datum.
    -   Cut speeds up to 55mm/s on 3mm MDF
    -   Hour meter 181.65 hours
