-   G.Weike LC1290/Big Red
    -   Head crash into bed? at 20181128 <https://groups.google.com/d/msg/artifactory-core/Nvj96_MpFSk/2j03fuWcAwAJ>
    -   RussellC testing 20181209:
        -   3mm ply cutting well
        -   some vibration when engraving at 200mm/sec, bottom of X belt vibrates - tension?
    -   Hour meter
        -   The hour meter started from 1.6 hours, at 20171210 , 475 beam-active cutting hours recorded over 12 months

-   G.Weike LG500/Little Red
    -   No Class 2 red aiming laser
    -   Keys dying on control pad - down arrow?
    -   Test cut nice and fast, 3mm MDF at over 15 mm/sec
        -   22mA, configured Max-Power still at 67
        -   Whiteboard says 9mm/sec? possibly less reliable cuts over the whole honeycomb workspace
        -   2018-12-17 Fletcher tests at 16mm/sec
-   KH-7050/Kellogg
    -   Has PC next to it - installed?
        -   Software seems to work?
        -   Kamil: Laser tube ready to install in the next week?
-   IainG's 25W Shiny Rabbit <https://fslaser.com/> table top laser cutter visiting for Canning STEAM, Science show @20181208/Little blue
    -   Currently borrowing Kellogg's compressor

-   LC1290/Big Red fault finding
    -   Laser is cutting very poorly, but displayed current is still OK
        -   If the tube is failing; it's our third (second arrived broken) Reci W6, installed 2016-12-28: so it has had about 1000 hours burn time?
        -   If the HV PSU is failing; it's our second MYJG-150 (150W), USD\$410+shipping, installed 2015-01? A suitable spare will probably be cheaper and we're inclined to get one regardless.
    -   Blake: Diagnostics yesterday 2018-12-16
        -   Cleaned mirrors, lens
        -   Checked alignment - OK
        -   No improvement \~20mm/s for 3mm MDF
        -   Tried to clean tube end
        -   Stopped cutting at all - just marking wood
        -   Still drawing 26mA
    -   Fault finding today
        -   We think could hear electrical arcing while laser running - 26mA
        -   Tried taking end cover off and recording video
            -   Cannot find actual arcing, possibly OK?
            -   STILL TO CHECK: Laser is operational, but is the plasma stable at both ends?
        -   Look for arcing of power supply - find nothing
        -   Take out power supply: model MYJG-150 (150W)
        -   Look through insulation for signs of arcing
            -   Maybe arcing at crimp
        -   Test outside with dummy load. milli-Ammeter in series and 1000:1 HV probe with multi meter
            -   102 kiloohm resistor (100W)
            -   When firing power supply ("Text" = "Test") button: 44mA, 4400V (193.6W)
            -   When connecting two dummy loads in series: 206 kiloohm: 42mA, 8700V (365.4W)
            -   The dummy loads do not drive the HV PSU at full power - 29000V (\~750W)
                -   130W to 145W output for \~20% power efficiency
