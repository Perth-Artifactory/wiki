        -   Pristine condition with new tube \>24mm/sec
        -   Focus is bad
        -   Blemish on partially silvered tube end
        -   Chengdu Weegiant 60W CO2 laser tube, expected 2000h lifespan, lasted 5+ years - better than any of the 100W+ tubes!
        -   New, improved (co-linear red targetting diode?) replacement about \$500 delivered?
    -   Using new lens "USA ZnSe Focusing Lens 50.8mm" - this is the \$25 one
        -   Was about 7mm/s for 3mm MDF when installed
    -   Removed and looked reasonably clean
    -   Trying "China ZnSe 63.5mm"
    -   Tried the "China ZnSe 50.8"
        -   Different height on focus target
        -   Focus still poor
        -   Loose nozzle-securing screw: stripped, replace&re-tap?
