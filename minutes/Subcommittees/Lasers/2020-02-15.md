# Laser Subcommittee Meeting 2020-02-15

-   Attendees: BlakeS, NickB, FletcherB, Beau
-   BlakeS: Trialing Saturday mornings
-   Possible rearrangement of machines for combined ducting and chiller stacking
-   We'd still like [red dot beam combiners](/subcommittee/laser-minutes-20191216), which would render getting a tube that has a built in aiming beam moot
    -   Would we like one?
        -   Nick, Blake: yes; Fletcher: no
            -   Fletcher: Recommends crowdfunding it at <https://finance.artifactory.org.au/>
                -   TODO
-   KH7050 Kellogg/Middle
    -   Fixed: Beau reported: Z pulley grub screw? was loose, came off, bed was not moving vertically
-   LG500 Little Red (out-of-order)
    -   Replacement tube: arrived, test fired: success
    -   Requires air extraction
-   LC1290 Big Red
    -   Vacuum internals
    -   Level bed (was out by 5mm, now within 1mm)
    -   Test fire setting was "stuck on"
        -   when triggered from button panel and from PC/LaserCut v5.3
        -   Set to \~99980ms
            -   Reset to 300ms MENU -\> LASER SET -\> LASER TIME
            -   Panel setting not saved/restored by PC "download configuration"?
    -   Empty compressor tanks (little content: recently done), water trap
    -   Hour meter
        -   The hour meter started from 1.6 hours, at 20171210 , 512 beam-active cutting hours per annum
