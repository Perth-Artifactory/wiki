# Laser Subcommittee Meeting 2020-05-16

-   Attendees: BlakeS, NickB, FletcherB, Felix
-   BlakeS: Trialing Saturday mornings
-   Possible rearrangement of machines for combined ducting and chiller stacking
-   We'd still like [red dot beam combiners](/subcommittee/laser-minutes-20191216), which would render getting a tube that has a built in aiming beam moot
    -   Would we like one?
        -   Nick, Blake: yes; Fletcher: no
            -   Fletcher: Recommends crowdfunding it at <https://finance.artifactory.org.au/>
                -   TODO
-   KH7050 Kellogg/Middle
    -   3mm MDF at 22mm/sec
-   LG500 Little Red (out-of-order)
    -   Requires air extraction
-   LC1290 Big Red
    -   Vacuum internals
    -   Reduce Z-stepper current, by DIP switches on the driver (was set to maximum: 7.8A, now 3.6A)
    -   Level bed, add 4 vent holes
    -   Empty compressor tanks, water trap (more content: needed doing)
    -   Hour meter
        -   The hour meter started from 1.6 hours, at 20171210 , 512 beam-active cutting hours per annum
