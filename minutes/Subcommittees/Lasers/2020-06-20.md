# Laser Subcommittee Meeting 2020-06-20

-   Attendees: BlakeS, NickB, Felix
-   Possible rearrangement of machines for combined ducting and chiller stacking
-   We'd still like [red dot beam combiners](/subcommittee/laser-minutes-20191216), which would render getting a tube that has a built in aiming beam moot
    -   Would we like one?
        -   Nick, Blake: yes; Fletcher: no
            -   Fletcher: Recommends crowdfunding it at <https://finance.artifactory.org.au/>
                -   TODO
-   KH7050 Kellogg/Middle
-   LG500 Little Red (out-of-order)
    -   Requires air extraction
    -   Test location near rear rollerdoor?
-   LC1290 Big Red
    -   Z-stepper current, set by DIP switches on the driver: raised to 4.3A, was peak-current 3.5A, (max is 7.8A)
        -   Occasional stiction at 3.5A: acquire grease?
    -   Level check bed: front RHS corner is up 2mm
    -   Vent holes: any feedback?
    -   Empty compressor tanks, water trap
    -   Hour meter
        -   The hour meter started from 1.6 hours, at 20171210 , 512 beam-active cutting hours per annum
