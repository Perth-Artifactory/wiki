# Laser Subcommittee Meeting 2020-08-15

-   Attendees: BlakeS, NickB, BenC
-   Possible rearrangement of machines for combined ducting and chiller stacking
-   We'd still like [red dot beam combiners](/subcommittee/laser-minutes-20191216), which would render getting a tube that has a built in aiming beam moot
    -   Would we like one?
        -   Nick, Blake: yes; Fletcher: no
            -   Fletcher: Recommends crowdfunding it at <https://finance.artifactory.org.au/>
                -   TODO
-   KH7050 Kellogg/Middle
    -   Cleaned by Blake
-   LG500 Little Red (out-of-order)
    -   Requires air extraction
    -   Test location near rear rollerdoor?
-   LC1290 Big Red
    -   2 failed gas struts:
        -   We're going to need a pair of struts, although maybe the next length down, 295mm, is the go?
        -   The removed right hand strut looks clean, but it's definitely not supporting 800N or close to it
        -   The remaining left hand strut looks failed and leaky
        -   Ben's machined up a clevis eye: a handy dandy M8 threaded right-angle adapter, which is what we need to attach the \$44 universal strut from:

            -   <https://www.strutspecialists.com.au/end_fittings_and_brackets>
        -   Alternatively: Beau: If we wanted to test if the 480N struts would work (without modifying the strut) we can use my car's ones before buying new ones (two ends, both cups)

    Replacement universal strut (or 295mm version?):
    ExtendedLength-pivot2pivot  AvailablePressures  PartNo.     Rod/Cylinder-mm     Stroke
    315mm   100N-to-1100N   U31510  10mm/22mm   125mm   $44.00
    We need another strut+clevis+M6/M8nut-and-bolt... and it's not
    going to easy to compress it that 800N to get in place, but doable.

    The originals were close to:
    http://www.aliexpress.com/store/product/ZDQG-Type-Model-No-QD19-293-114-800-800N-Gas-spring-for-laser-machine/904631_32647352181.html
    (USD$72 for 4 struts, I believe the measurements are 800N of
    pressure/force, 293mm pivot-point to pivot-point maximum, 114mm of piston
    movement, 19mm? diameter)

    Alternatively, maybe a car strut would do the trick, might be able to get
    a 400-500N 293/295mm pair of struts for a Falcodore boot or Landrover bonnet?
    and a couple of the ball studs from Strut Specialists.
