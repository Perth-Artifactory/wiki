# Laser Subcommittee Meeting 2020-09-19

-   Attendees: BlakeS, NickB, BenC, AdamM
-   Beau: Possible rearrangement of machines for combined ducting and chiller stacking
    -   measure ducting, plan for rotating: LC1290 -90degrees; KH7090 90degrees
    -   extra exhaust duct for LG500 would need 8m of \~100mm diameter tube
-   We'd still like [red dot beam combiners](/subcommittee/laser-minutes-20191216), which would render getting a tube that has a built in aiming beam moot
    -   Would we like one?
        -   Nick, Blake: yes; Fletcher: no
            -   Fletcher: Recommends crowdfunding it at <https://finance.artifactory.org.au/>
                -   TODO
-   KH7050 Kellogg/Middle
    -   Focused by Blake
-   LG500 Little Red (out-of-order)
    -   Requires air extraction
    -   Test location near rear rollerdoor?
-   LC1290 Big Red
    -   BenC: Move rear right limit switch, new mounting shim holes 10mm/15mm
    -   BenC, AdamM: Fix XY squareness
        -   cut 400 x 397.5 mm "parallelogram"
        -   line up gantry at midway Y point
        -   undo coupling screws in axle under laser tube, wind Y to resquare (using dial gauge) and fasten coupling screws
        -   cut 600 x 595.5 mm "square", 708mm both diagonals
    -   relevel: gap was 11/11/12/18 (!)mm in back right corner
        -   detension&adjust righthand Z belt
    -   Empty compressor tanks, water trap
    -   Hour meter
        -   The hour meter started from 1.6 hours, at 20171210 , 512 beam-active cutting hours per annum
