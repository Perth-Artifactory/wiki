# Laser Subcommittee Meeting 2020-10-17

-   Attendees: BlakeS, NickB, AdamM
    -   Next meeting(s): Third Saturday 14:00 ? OK
-   We'd still like [red dot beam combiners](/subcommittee/laser-minutes-20191216), which would render getting a tube that has a built in aiming beam moot
    -   Would we like one?
        -   Nick, Blake: yes; Fletcher: no
            -   Fletcher: Recommends crowdfunding it at <https://finance.artifactory.org.au/>
                -   TODO
-   LG500 Little Red (out-of-order)
    -   Requires air extraction
    -   Test location near rear rollerdoor?
-   KH7050 Kellogg/Middle
    -   cutting 3mm MDF in centre of bed at 28+mm/s
-   LC1290 Big Red
    -   cutting 3mm MDF in centre of bed at 40mm/s
    -   level is out, rear right is often slipping:
        -   relevel: gap was 10/6/10/18 (!)mm in back right corner
        -   detension&adjust righthand Z belt
    -   Empty compressor tanks, water trap
        -   TODO: KamilS has solenoid for auto-purge of main tank
            -   stored in LC1290 control cavity
            -   secondary tank and line trap will need occasional purge
    -   Hour meter
        -   The hour meter started from 1.6 hours, at 20171210 , 512 beam-active cutting hours per annum
