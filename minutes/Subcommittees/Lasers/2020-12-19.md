# Laser Subcommittee Meeting 2020-12-19

-   Attendees: BlakeS, NickB, AdamM, FletcherB, BeauD, BenC
    -   Next meeting(s): Four weeks: Saturday 14:00 ? OK
-   We'd still like [red dot beam combiners](/subcommittee/laser-minutes-20191216), which would render getting a tube that has a built in aiming beam moot
    -   Would we like one?
        -   Nick, Blake: yes; Fletcher: no
            -   Fletcher: Recommends crowdfunding it at <https://finance.artifactory.org.au/>
                -   TODO
-   LG500 Little Red (out-of-order)
    -   Time to re-commission!
    -   Requires air extraction, Y fitting
    -   PC needs a new bios battery
    -   LG500+KH7090 now share a chiller; and the same power switch (wall GPO)
        -   Thanks to all who helped out!
    -   Little red commissioning went a few steps forward but more work is required to have it running
-   KH7050 Kellogg/Middle
    -   Cleaned lens
    -   cutting 3mm MDF in centre of bed at 30mm/s
-   LC1290 Big Red
    -   Moved: Back to courtyard wall
        -   air tap on left, towards the rollerdoor
    -   Cleaned lens
    -   Clean and grease X rails, Y rails Hiwin HGN-15 style rails (15mm wide)
        -   Not so good! Try lithium grease spray, Superlube is more a corrosion inhibitor: <s>(Superlube 21030 e.g. <https://www.mektronics.com.au/super-lube-anti-corrosion-connector-gel-3-oz-tube.html>)</s>
    -   Test beam alignment top left, bottom right: identical!
        -   Slightly top left of target
    -   cutting 3mm MDF in centre of bed... cleanly, but only at 20-25mm/s - should be 45+mm/s
        -   <https://perthartifactory.slack.com/archives/CB9S94S2E/p1608364021229300?thread_ts=1608203358.226700&cid=CB9S94S2E>
        -   Clean mirrors: done
        -   End of laser tube: not pristine, but cleaning it is a last resort
        -   Starting to suspect the tube
            -   Current is 23-24mA, OK (Max is 26mA)
            -   should be good for 10000 hours
            -   it has had more like 950 power-on hours, over the past two years (installed 2018-12-22)
            -   Try an output power test and see if it's close to its factory-measured 100W; or closer to 50W actual
    -   Ben: Diagnosed loss of bed level: there is vertical movement in the threaded rods under the bed
        -   the rods are not attached to the bearings and can move vertically if there is sufficient room - the floor or the sheet metal of the LC1290 may not be fixed
        -   the movement is limited, not an unlimited slipping of steps or teeth
            -   the rods can be sitting flush down on the bearing, or may be raised up
        -   Extra/thicker shims at the top could remove the slack space
    -   Empty compressor tanks, water trap
        -   TODO: KamilS has solenoid for auto-purge of main tank
            -   stored in LC1290 control cavity
            -   secondary tank and line trap will need occasional purge
    -   Hour meter
        -   The hour meter started from 1.6 hours, at 20171210 , 400-512 beam-active cutting hours per annum
