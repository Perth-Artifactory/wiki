# Laser Subcommittee Meeting 2021-01-16

-   Attendees: BlakeS, NickB, FletcherB, BeauD, BenC, Guy, VincentD, Phoebe
    -   Next meeting(s): Five weeks: regular third Saturday 14:00 ? OK
-   We'd still like [red dot beam combiners](/subcommittee/laser-minutes-20191216), which would render getting a tube that has a built in aiming beam moot
    -   Would we like one?
        -   Nick, Blake: yes; Fletcher: no
            -   Fletcher: Recommends crowdfunding it at <https://finance.artifactory.org.au/>
                -   TODO
-   BenC: measured chiller cable:
    -   3 pin DIN at chiller end, connected to 4 pin DIN at LC1290 end, pin 1+3 straight through to pin 1+3 at other end
    -   pin 1+3 is a NC relay output; continuity is broken when chiller alarm triggers
-   LG500 Little Red (out-of-order)
    -   Time to re-commission!
    -   Requires air extraction, Y fitting
-   KH7050 Kellogg/Middle
    -   Cleaned lens, mirrors
        -   X mirror, travelling gantry was fairly dirty
        -   Cutting double images -\> X mirror realign
    -   cutting 3mm MDF in centre of bed at 22-25mm/s
    -   Clean and grease rails, lithium grease spray
-   LC1290 Big Red
    -   Cleaned lens
    -   Clean and grease X rails, Y rails Hiwin HGN-15 style rails (15mm wide)
        -   Try lithium grease spray
    -   Current was low - 18mA; BS+FB raised it back to 26mA but cut speeds did not improve
    -   cutting 3mm MDF in centre of bed at 25-30mm/s
    -   Make HV PSU controller/display accessible, mount near control panel
        -   Reads 18kV to 22kV, 16-25mA, 0-3.3V "control voltage"; depending on "Max-Power" percentage as set in LaserCut (HV-PSU has not been adjusted directly)
    -   cutting 3mm MDF in centre of bed... at 20mm/s?
    -   Empty compressor tanks (needed), water trap (already done)
        -   TODO: KamilS has solenoid for auto-purge of main tank
            -   stored in LC1290 control cavity
            -   secondary tank and line trap will need occasional purge
    -   Hour meter
        -   The hour meter started from 1.6 hours, at 20171210 , 400-512 beam-active cutting hours per annum
