# Laser Subcommittee Meeting 2021-02-20

-   Attendees: BlakeS, NickB, FletcherB, BeauD, BenC
    -   Next meeting(s): Four weeks: regular third Saturday 14:00 ? OK
-   We'd still like [red dot beam combiners](/subcommittee/laser-minutes-20191216), which would render getting a tube that has a built in aiming beam moot
    -   Would we like one?
        -   Nick, Blake: yes; Fletcher: no
            -   Fletcher: Recommends crowdfunding it at <https://finance.artifactory.org.au/>
                -   TODO
        -   but the LC1290 is getting a SPT tube with co-linear aiming beam!
-   LG500 "Little Red" (out-of-order)
    -   Time to re-commission!
    -   LG500+KH7050
        -   Shared chiller lines, both running off the CW-5200 refrigeration unit, set for 25.5 degrees C
            -   CW-5000 unit is spare, same as the LC1290's
        -   Test shared air extraction, Y fitting
            -   Tested: extraction power has suffered a bit on the KH7050
    -   New tube was installed (not the original [Chengdu Weegiant](http://www.cdgri.com/) 60W CO2 laser tube)
        -   TODO: Update: [lg500_parameters](/lasercutters/lg500_parameters)
    -   cutting 3mm MDF in centre of bed at 35mm/s
    -   PC needs network - no link light when connected to the last remaining switchport
        -   8 port LiteWave LS108G switch on toolroom wall
-   KH7050 "Kellogg/Middle"
    -   Air jet at laser head: poor
        -   Fletcher: Compressor is blowing plenty, run a thicker air line? increase the head nozzle diameter?
            -   Thicker line -\> thicker <https://www.cloudraylaser.com/collections/drag-chain> / cable snake
            -   Ben: has spare from Swarfomat upgrades - voil√†
-   LC1290 "Big Red"
    -   Tube is dying, 130W replacement is in the mail
        -   130W SPT tube with co-linear aiming beam! \~\$1500 from aliexpress.com , thanks Blake!
        -   TODO: Update: [lc1290_parameters](/lasercutters/lc1290_parameters)
    -   cutting 3mm MDF in centre of bed at 25mm/s
    -   Empty compressor tanks, water trap
        -   TODO: KamilS has solenoid for auto-purge of main tank
            -   stored in LC1290 control cavity
            -   secondary tank and line trap will need occasional purge
    -   Hour meter
        -   The hour meter started from 1.6 hours, at 20171210 , 400-512 beam-active cutting hours per annum
