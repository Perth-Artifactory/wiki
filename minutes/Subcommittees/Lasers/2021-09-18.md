    -   Used the z height spacer tool to enforce some offset between lens assembly and gantry. Allows for some room to take up in certain head crash scenarios
    -   Noted that the threaded locking ring for lens binds in holder. Perhaps the ring is too small diameter. Consider requesting a larger diameter locking ring is manufactured.
