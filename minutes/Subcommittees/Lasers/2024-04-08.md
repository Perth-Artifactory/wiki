Present:
* Blake Samuels
* Fletcher Boyd
* Nick Bannon

### LC1290 "Big red"

* Resquare: BenM reported out-of-alignment 2024-03-26 https://perthartifactory.slack.com/archives/C01HWH1E0NN/p1711409833170779
  * Blake+Fletcher squared 2024-03-27
  * 2024-04-08 remeasure, resquare:
    * cut a 500x500mm squared: measured 708 top-left-bottom-right x 705.5 top-right-bottom-left diagonals, target is sqrt(500^2 + 500^2)=707.1mm
    * opposite skew to last time!
    * tweak 1: loosen y-axis synchronisation left/right joiner (in front of tube), quarter turn?, tighten; adjust mirror #2: 705x708
    * tweak 2: loosen y-axis sync joiner, 1/8 turn back?, tighten; adjust mirror #2: 707.5x706.5, done!
* Lewis: Lens was replaced 2024-04-03 - burnt/chipped edge section: https://perthartifactory.slack.com/archives/C01HWH1E0NN/p1712428675255199 https://perthartifactory.slack.com/archives/C04AFPP8PME/p1712159345937789
  * laser misaligned to edge of lens?
* Nudge lens alignment
  * a lock nut on mirror #2 has detritus, clean
  * adjustment on base support of mirror #2 is maxed out but would have to move a little more to beam directly into the current laser head
    * centre of the laser head is further from the gantry beam than the centre of mirror #2
    * mill a replacement base adjustment section?
* Bed is close to level: measure clockwise: 19 21 19 21 mm to target
