# 2024-05-20 Laser Maintenance

Present:
* Blake Samuels

* Justin Richards
* Nick Bannon

### LC1290 "Big red"

* report 2024-05-18: Lewis Yip: round holes coming out oval/burning at rear left: https://perthartifactory.slack.com/archives/C01HWH1E0NN/p1716033065535659
* report 2024-05-18: BlakeS: Big red laser tube current was 34mA on the display which is above the 25 to 30mA recommended by manufacturer. I've tweaked the pot down and it's at 28mA now but bit of a worry. Pot has needed tweaking a few times now. Maybe a better/more stable voltage divider is needed. https://perthartifactory.slack.com/archives/C01HWH1E0NN/p1716042250227339
* Resquare: Justin checking y-axis synchronisation left/right joiner (in front of tube)
  * 500mm square: 707.5x706.5mm diagonal
* "Co-linear" aiming dot is not spot on, IR beam hits the head slightly down and to the rear
