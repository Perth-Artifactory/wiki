Present:
* Blake Samuels
* Fletcher Boyd

### LC1290 "Big red"

* [Work progressed on rotary axis](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/lasers/us/16?kanban-status=37)
  * Our controller can't connect the rotary as it's own axis, still needs to be on Y. LightBurn supports it better though.
* Seems to be cutting fine

### KH7090 "Middle red"

* No action taken

### Fibre marking laser

* No action taken, see [Taiga](https://tasks.artifactory.org.au/project/lasers/us/6?kanban-status=37) for current status (no change)
