# New Members Guide

Welcome to the Artifactory!

Please take a few minutes to read this New Members Guide to orientate yourself with our ways and practices.

## Official stuff

-   [Membership Info](/membership) - Details of what types of membership are available, benefits, etc.
-   It is a legal requirement for The Artifactory to maintain a register of members, with full name, email or address, and contact details.
-   The Rules - [Constitution](Constitution) & [By-laws](/committee/committeerulings#by-laws/)
-   [The Committee](/committee/start)
-   The Perth Artifactory [Emergency Plan is available for viewing here](https://wiki.artifactory.org.au/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=events:artifactory_emergency_plan_-_june_2019.png) in addition to those displayed in every single room of the Artifactory. It shows the location of the first aid kits, Fire extinguishers/hose, switchboard, muster point and escape route.

## The Space is Communal

We are designated as a factory space.

      * Ensure access areas are kept clean, tools are safe
      * Ensure that your clothing is appropriate.

Keep it nice for everyone else:

      * **pick up your rubbish,**
      * wipe, sweep or vacuum your area after use,
      * put away the stuff you used,
      * vacuums and dustpan & brooms are in abundance.
      * **Leave the space cleaner than you found it.**
    * [[committee:policies:Dangerous Projects And Tools Policy]]
    * Do not use power wood cutting tools inside, nor spray paints - the dust can affect electronics, furniture, and other member's breathing. Try to avoid use of resins or other volatiles inside as well. The exception here is locations specifically designated for this purpose.

## Storage Space

### Member Storage (Lockers and Tubs)

Members are entitled (subject to availability) to a single committee authorised storage space (up to 150L) left in a tidy and safe state. It maybe a locker or storage space on the pallet rack. Full [Member Storage](/committee/committeerulings#member_storage) rules can be found in the bylaws.

**No guarantees are made to the security of your belongings on site.**

#### To get a storage space

    -Contact the [[start#committee_and_other_responsible_members|Member Storage Officer (storage@artifactory.org.au)]] or a [[committee:start#committee_and_other_responsible_members|Committee Member]] with your request for storage.  If a preferred location is known, please state that in your request.
    -If there is no waiting list for storage you will be allocated with a spot promptly
    -Mark the Locker/Tub with your full name and phone number or email.
    -**Don't Put Expensive Stuff in it**

#### Member Storage & Termination of Membership

If you cancel your membership via resignation, termination etc your belongings will be stored for a period of one month. Once period has expired the belongings will be claimed by the association and may be used or disposed of as the Management Committee sees fit. Full details see the bylaw [Member Storage point 3](/committee/committeerulings#member_storage)

### Additional Member Storage

Members are entitled to request for additional storage on the pallet racking. Additional storage will be charged at a rate of \$60 per half a pallet rack per month and will be restricted to the upper racks. For further information see the [bylaws](/committee/committeerulings#member_storage_-_additional). Contact the [committee](/committee/start#committee_and_other_responsible_members) to arrange. To date the committee has not authorised a storage space under this By-Law due to space constraints in the workshop.

## Heavy Tool Use

      * Heavy Tools mean everything in the [[:heavytoolroom:]] and some tools stored in the welding bay and machining area.
      * No one can use Heavy Tools unless they have been inducted by an existing certified member. If you're not familiar with their safe operation, you could kill yourself, REALLY.
      * A list of certified users for each tool is available on the [[:tools:]] page.
      * Make sure you know where the First Aid Kit is, currently in the kitchen.
      * ALWAYS use safety gear - goggles, earplugs, masks. Preferably only use Heavy Tools when someone else is in the building in case of serious accidents.

## Communal Materials

-   There are supplies of free wood and acrylic next to Big Red. The specific location will be shown to you during laser training or you can ask an existing member.
-   Items left on the *Upcycle* bench are free game.
-   The kitchen has a small quantity of cleaning products etc.
-   Filing Cabinet in the shed contains paints / spray paints for communal use unless otherwise labelled.
-   Stuff on the Hack Rack.
-   Otherwise **check** with another member before you start using supplies. Many supplies belong to individual members.
-   If you find you are using a lot of a communal supply like Turpentine, Gaffer Tape, etc, you should **buy more** for the Artifactory.

## Communications

[Slack](https://space.artifactory.org.au/slack) is the number one point of contact for anything and everything Artifactory.

      * If you would like to be **trained on a certain machine,** **reporting a fault** with the equipment or even need **input and advice** for your current project there will usually be a specific channel for your question. If you're not sure ask in #general.
    * Social Media
      * Twitter users, follow [[http://twitter.com/PerthArtifact|PerthArtifact]] and tag your related posts with [[http://twitter.com/search?q=#PerthArtifactory|#PerthArtifactory]].
      * Facebook users, remember to check in and like us at [[http://facebook.com/perthartifactory|Facebook]].
      * Meetup users can also interact with our events on [[https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Perth-Artifactory/|Meetup]].
    * Reporting injuries (or near misses) helps us keep everyone safe. Use [[https://cloud.artifactory.org.au/apps/forms/62rTWpZH4fr5di2H|this form]] to document the details while they're fresh in your mind.

## Tech Resources

-   The Member Work directory can be accessed in a few different ways:
    -   From any computer in the space (Typically mounted as either "filer" or "Member Work")
    -   From your device when connected to the wifi. (You'll need to mount the filer SMB share, ask someone if you don't know how to do this)
    -   From your device regardless of where you're connected via our Nextcloud instance. You can request access [here](https://cloud.artifactory.org.au/apps/forms/CRDidNysNjBwbwKN)
-   The label printer can be accessed from [this page](https://i.perart.io/label) when connected to the wifi.
-   You can ask to be shown on the [webcam feed](https://space.artifactory.org.au/) by filling out [this form](https://cloud.artifactory.org.au/apps/forms/CSNEkreDRn9GNgw3).
