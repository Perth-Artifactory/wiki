Welcome to the Artifactory!

Before you start using the space, please -

  2. Go through the [Visitor Orientation - slide show](https://perart.io/visitor_induction) - to familiarise yourself with our policies and procedures.
  3. Ask an Artifactory volunteer to walk around with you and show you the items on the last slide of the Visitor Orientation.
  4. Ask an Artifactory volunteer to record that you have completed `Induction (Visitor)` in Training Tracker.

**Happy making!**
