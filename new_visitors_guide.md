Welcome to the Artifactory!

Please take a few minutes to read this New Visitors Guide to orientate yourself with our ways and practices.

## Official stuff

* [Code of Conduct](/docs/committee/code_of_conduct)
    * **Very important to read!** - Our expectations for how we treat each other, and how we treat the space.
    
* We're a fully volunteer organisation run by a [committee](/docs/committee/home).
    * You can contact the committee at any time via Slack or email - committee@artifactory.org.au.
    
* Please keep your personal details up-to-date in TidyHQ.
    * Please sign up as a visitor [here](https://perart.io/visitor). That page will collect some important information like your emergency contact details. It's also how we track tool inductions!
    
* Day Passes can be paid for at the bar
    * In most cases it costs $20 to attend the space for the day though some events are cheaper. If you're not sure check with an event host!
    * Please write your name and "day pass" on the merchant receipt and put it in the red box next to the EFTPOS.

* [Training](/docs/policies/training)
    * Training is needed to use most of the power tools in the space.
    * Some training is restricted to members.
    * **Please read the [Training](/docs/policies/training) policy for more details.**

* [By-Laws](/docs/policies/bylaws)
    * Policies regarding what you can (and can't) do in the space, things you have to ask permission before doing, and various administrative matters.
    * Note that some of these are only applicable to members, not day pass users.

* [Constitution](/constitution)
    * If you're curious this is the overarching document that defines how we operate.
    
* The Perth Artifactory Emergency Plan is displayed at the entrance of the Artifactory. It shows the location of the first aid kits, Fire extinguishers/hose, switchboard, muster point and escape route.

* Reporting injuries (or near misses) helps us keep everyone safe. Use [this form](https://cloud.artifactory.org.au/apps/forms/62rTWpZH4fr5di2H) to document the details while they're fresh in your mind.

## The Space is Communal

We are designated as a factory space.

* Ensure access areas are kept clean, tools are safe.
* Ensure that your clothing is appropriate.
* Refer [Code of Conduct](/docs/committee/code_of_conduct) regarding *Safe Use of Tools*.

Keep it nice for everyone else:

* **Leave the space cleaner than you found it.**
* Pick up your rubbish.
* Put away everything you used.
* Clean the area you worked in - wipe, sweep, vacuum.
* Do not use power wood cutting tools inside, nor spray paints - the dust can affect electronics, furniture, and other member's breathing. Try to avoid use of resins or other volatiles inside as well. The exception here is locations specifically designated for this purpose.
* Refer [Code of Conduct](/docs/committee/code_of_conduct) regarding *Respectful Behaviour*.

Everyone who helps you (training, assistance, advice, ...) is a member or day pass holder like you, volunteering their time for free. Please repay their kindness by:
* Checking the whiteboard near the front of the space for things that haven't been done in a while
* Helping with the communal cleaning - empty the bins, vacuum the project area
* Tidying up the space - sort the hardware drawers, neaten the tool racks
* Volunteering to help with a project or event - ask any committee member - there's always lots to do!

## Storage Space

As a day pass user you are unable to leave items in the space, please plan ahead if doing projects that involve paint drying etc.

Anything which is left in the space un-labelled will be either treated as [lost and found](/docs/policies/storage#lost-and-found) or [disposed of](/docs/policies/storage#disposal-of-property).

## Access to the space

As a day pass user, your access to the space is limited to the [events on our calendar](https://artifactory.org.au/events).

## Heavy Tool Use                 

* See: [Training](/docs/policies/training)
* Heavy tools will be pointed out to you during your initial tour. We recommend using Slack (see below) to organise training.
* No one can use Heavy Tools unless they have been inducted by one of our trainers. If you're not familiar with their safe operation you may pose a significant risk to life and property.
* Make sure you know where the First Aid Kit is.
* Always use appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE). What equipment is appropriate for each tool is part of the tool induction.

## Fees

See [Fees](/docs/policies/fees) for full list.

Tool usage fees need to be paid using bank transfer. [Bank details](/docs/committee/bank_details).

Tool usage fees are payable at the end of the day when you use the tool.

* Selected quick links:
  * [3D Printing - FDM](/docs/policies/fees#h-3d-printer-fdm)
  * [CNC router](/docs/policies/fees#cnc-router-swarf-o-mat)
  * [Laser - Big Red](/docs/policies/fees#laser-cutter-big-red)
  * [Laser - Middle Red](/docs/policies/fees#laser-cutter-middle-red)

## Communal Materials

* Crafting materials
  * Laser scrap rack
  * Upcycle rack
* Cleaning products: kitchen
* Otherwise **check** with a member before you start using supplies. Many supplies belong to individual members.
* If you find you are using a lot of a communal supply (super glue, turpentine, masking tape, wood screws...), or you have used up the last of something, you should **buy more** for the Artifactory.

## Communications

[Slack](https://perart.io/slack) is the number one point of contact for anything and everything Artifactory.

* If you would like to be **trained on a certain machine**, **report a fault** with the equipment, or even need **input and advice** for your current project there will usually be a specific channel for your question. If you're not sure ask in #general.

### Social Media

* Facebook users, remember to check in and like us on [Facebook](https://facebook.com/perthartifactory).
* Reviews on [Google Maps](https://maps.app.goo.gl/SB5iAEN4LBVAppt39) and Facebook are always appreciated.
* Meetup users can also interact with our events on [Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/en-AU/Perth-Artifactory/)

## Tech Resources

* You can create a folder in our "Member Work" network server (despite the name). It's connectable from all of our workstations.
