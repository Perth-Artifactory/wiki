# Compressed Air Line

This project is to provide air for various uses around the space. It will be completed in several phases based on time, availability, materials and a bunch of other factors.

## Phase one

Ran piping from the large compressor (next to lasers) over the machine room, across the far room and up to the front roller door. This was done with (specifics?) heat bonded tubing.

## Future

-   shift compressor outside under cover - requires a hole in the wall, external power and protection against the elements.
-   24/7 compressor - the current machine is not designed to be left on.
-   compressor to lasers - they currently have dedicate small compressors which come on with the machine
-   compressor to Swarf - as above
-   compressor to machine room
-   compressor to sand blaster
-   additional outlets
-   automated water trap emptying.
