# Basic Arduino Beginners Kit

## What is this?

There are often attendees at Arduino U who are just starting out and have not yet invested in any hardware. This kit is targeted at these people and the selection of items has been informed by the following principles:

-   **CHEAP** Genuine Arduino or official clone is around \$35. This is a quite an investment when you don't even know what the thing is yet!
-   **Basic but comprehensive**. The kit should have a wide enough selection of VERY BASIC parts to allow construction of SIMPLE circuits for all the "example" programs that come with the IDE.
-   **Fruit is Fun!** There should be at least a few "complex" components to allow at least a glimpse of what the platform is capable of.
-   **Available NOW!** Cheap components and parts are readily available from various Chinese websites, but these usually take a month or more to arrive. In any case, beginners will generally not know what to order from such sites.

Target cost for the entire kit is \< \$20. Sale price will be around \$30. The \$10 profit will go directly to the space. There are plenty of premium price Arduino kit products out there already - this needs to be a basic beginner hack pack that gives good value for money.

## V1.0 Kit Contents

(Total cost of V1.0 kit = \$20.57 on 16/12/14)

Kit will be packaged with cheap plastic bags, paper and cardboard inside a laser cut Artifactory branded MDF case.
