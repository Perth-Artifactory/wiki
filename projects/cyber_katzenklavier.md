Inspired by the truly strange theories of an ibscure german late 18th century thinker who thought that building a distressed-cat-based klavier was a good way to cure mental illness (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katzenklavier>) and the Muppet Show act in a similar vein of a guy that beat up a bunch of tuned fluffy creatures with a large hammer, I propose we build our own KatzenKlavier with soft toys, piezos, and Ardunios to do the trigger processing into MIDI or similar.

-   What: Fluffy electronic triggered musical device
-   Who: SKoT (Dave? Trent to advise on Arduinos?)
-   Why: Because beating up soft toys is fun. Come on, an electronic drum kit made up of foul looking soft toys... always good for the soul as you lay into them.
-   Precedent: In the 90s we used to take a bunch of piezo-rigged soft toys linked to a an Alesis DM5 drum module to gigs.
-   Materials:
    -   Arduino (tick!)
    -   Piezos
    -   Soft toys (tick! I have a bunch of expendable soft toys left over from halloween)
