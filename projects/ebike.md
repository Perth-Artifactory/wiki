One old Suzuki GN250, add 20 90ah lithium ferrous phosphate batteries and a Perm 132 motor.

Top speed: tested on the freeway and has gone 110km/h Range: ? unknown ? I have driven it 20km without significant battery drain but full range has yet to be tested.

The Ebike has a new motor, has been reassembled and is now fully functional with its new chain guards and 12 volt key activated contactor.

The bike now needs to be weighed and have the final engineers inspection completed before heading over the pits.

Historical problems The original bike had almost all of the electronics passing through the headlight. This made it very difficult to work with and the headlight itself was wearing out. The headlight has been replaced with a kit model. The first motor I bought eventually died after a few test runs. This is presumably due to something getting into the motor cog and grinding a lot of the plates off. This set me back almost a year but I have sucked up enough cash for a new motor and reassembled it all. Plus added a motor guard to hopefully prevent a repeat.
