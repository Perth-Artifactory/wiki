# Flat Pack Dice

This is a simple six sided dice distributed on a 3mm MDF card. Each card takes sround 4 minutes to cut on the small laser cutter and cannot be cut with the large laser due to the small text on each item.

It is not designed to snap together (ie interferance fit) as this would prevent being able to cut common lines once and would therefore make the flat pack larger and take longer to produce.

It also looks good when cut from 3mm plywood.

If sold they are usually priced at \$2 each, or given away.

The sprue (tab) cut is made with a faster cut which hopefully does not cut all the way through the material.
