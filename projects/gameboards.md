# Gaming Boards

## Inspiration

Both Pen&Paper RPGs and war-games often need a game board - for war-games to play on and for RPGs to visualise the complex combat situations. The ideal board would be customisable, and be clearly marked with a grid or hexes for the easy calculation of lines of sight, ranges and areas of effect. Once I saw what Swarf-o-mat could do, it was a short step to thinking I could start designing and carving my own RPG terrain.

## Material

6mm and 9 mm MDF (fancier wood also possible)  
Pinkasyl (Silicone moulding liquid)  
EasyCast (Resin)  

## Equipment & Tools

Swarf-O-Mat  
Sandpaper  

## Stage 1: Bases

The first question was squares or hexes, but they quickly multiplied from there. How big should the squares/hexes be? How much space between them? Where were the walls going to go, and how was I going to stack levels on these things?

Nice thin lines between the hexes were all very nice looking, but they required the 3mm drill bit, which is slow and fragile. Going to 6mm halved the number of passes required, and allowed me to think about nice thick walls between the hexes. Previously I'd been thinking about straight 3mm walls running along the hex centres, but wiggly walls running along the hex borders, and the interesting shapes you can create when constrained by hexes ended up being the deciding factor.
