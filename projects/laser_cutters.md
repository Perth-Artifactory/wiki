# Lasercutters

## Summary

The Artifactory is sadly lacking in one of the most popular (and awesometastic) tools common to many hackerspaces, the Lasercutter. Not content with a small and meek machine it was decided that we should seek help with funding our coherent light related ambitions and so we turned to the wonderful folk at LotteryWest who provided us a grant of \$11k for the purchase of Lasercutters!
