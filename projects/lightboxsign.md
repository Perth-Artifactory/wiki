# Lightbox Sign

\*\* -- THE BEACON IS CURRENTLY UNDER REPAIRS -- \*\*

The Artifactory has an illuminated sign above the door to the space. It is controlled by an Arduino and can be reprogrammed via an FTDI cable connected through the switch box.  
===== Operation ===== To turn the sign on, there is a switch box on the wall to the right of the door (Looking Out).

| This means the sign is **off**.                                                                     | And this means its turned **on**.                                                                   |

Power is supplied via a 5v plugpack that connects to the bottom of the switchbox.
