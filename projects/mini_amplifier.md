# Mini Amplifier

Everyone need a mini amplifier, don't they?

Using the power and awesomeness that is [Swarf-O-Mat](Swarf-O-Mat) combined with fine pitched surface mount technology, solder paste and the hot air solder station we will build a mini but powerful stereo amp with custom build aluminium case/heat-sink. I might even be able to characterise it with a nice spectrum analyser at work. -- PCBs have been come back from [Hackvana](http://www.hackvana.com/store/), and look great. Still need to make the case ......
