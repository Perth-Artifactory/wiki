# RotoBot CNC

## Project Brief

Owing to exposure to SKoT's magnificent [Swarf-O-Mat](/projects/swarf-o-mat) CNC, I have been bitten by the CNC bug and have set about collecting the bits and pieces needed to build my very own 4 axis CNC machine. The fourth axis being a rotary axis parallel to the work table.
