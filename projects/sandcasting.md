SAND CASTING / OIL BURNER / FORGE

20/04/12

Given the other concrete projects going on we're moving towards making the forge sooner than later.

What we currently need :

     * Pearlite (for making the refractory)
     * An old storage hot water system (so we can salvage the boiler as an alternate forge housing)
     * A blower (any decent squirrel cage motor and housing or an old leaf blower)
     * A bit of 2" steel pipe
     * The male inlet fitting / manifold off a busted BBQ (to attach the propane hose to)

16/01/12

The plan (at this point) it to start by building a oil burner (sourcing parts as we speak) and then build a forge - probably in the discarded keg Oliver left in the courtyard.

Lots of useful info at :

Initial casts will be aluminium. Hopefully we can upgrade to bronze / brass for those extra arty things...

And we'll probably have to build a muller to prepare propper green sand for casting.
