The proposed membership kiosk (to be located somewhere useful, but not in the way of hacking spaces -- perhaps in the foyer or near the kitchen?) will allow:

-   members to tap their tag and verify:
    -   personal details up to date
    -   "restricted group" membership -- such as Laser, Swarf-o-mat, Band Member etc
    -   membership level (and "in credit" status)
    -   Redirection to tidyHQ for topups (or stripe?)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   trainers to add/remove members from special groups (on completion of training session)

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   pretty display of member project slideshow when not being used.

##### Hardware

Raspberry Pi. Wired network connection. Monitor (wall mountable), kbd/mouse and RFID reader.

Needs to be tidy looking as will be in a public area. any custom hardware (RFID Reader etc) needs be well documented so that spares can be on hand.

##### Software

Kiosk-mode browser + screensaver

Everything should be remote as much as possible so that we can have multiple of these things.
