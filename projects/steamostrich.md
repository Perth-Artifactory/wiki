## Steam Ostrich

##### Who

Doctor Vellocet, aka [SKoT McDonald](/user/skot), reowned electrostolic-gizmologist and devil-may-care adventuring-type-person.

##### What

Doctor Vellocet's Steam-powered Ostrich. "Your Personal Antarctic Avian" (tm). "Steam Ostrich" for short. Or "The Turkey" (read: White Elephant) when Dr V is wondering where all his time and money is going.

##### Why

Because if you tried to explore the Antarctic wastes with normal Ostrich, it wouldn't survive, silly.

##### Are you crazy

Probably.

### Facilities

-   2 walker-legs
-   neck-mounted tea-pot head for dispensing reviving Tea even in the more inhospitable environments
-   Side mounted auto-loading chain-fed machine-nerf-run for dispensing bursts of civilizing nerf upon any savages/endangered species/irreplaceable archaeological treasures.
-   Plush velvet seat
-   Missile switch!
-   4 port exhaust stack (wonky). Construction: cardboard toilet tubes, angle-cut at ends and hot-glued together for welding effect. One has a rain-protection witches' hat.

### Trickery

-   Welding effect - thanks to Jenna! - Using "bunched up" lines of hot glue applied to sheets of MDF for the 3D texture, then coating in a solid under layer of black paint, followed by rapid dry brushing of silver and just a hint of gold for a slightly bronzy/brassy look.
-   iron exhaust pipes - toilet rolls. "Pipe kinks" achieved by cutting ends cut on slight diagonals, and hot gluing for bonus welding.
-   Legs moved by virtue of Ostrich ankles tied to actors.
