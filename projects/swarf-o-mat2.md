# Son Of Swarf-o-Mat

-   What: a smaller scale CNC router / engraver than [Swarf-o-mat](/Projects/Swarf-o-mat), this is to be for jobs like cutting small labels and signs, milling smaller parts etc so that Swarf-o-mat isn't locked up doing tiny stuff.
-   Who: [SKoT](/User/SKoT)
-   Materials/parts gathered so far:
    -   Stepper motors (4)
    -   Controller card (ex swarf-o-mat)
    -   2 linear actuators (thanks Rod)
-   Materials still needed:
    -   Frame
    -   Spindle
    -   Spindle controller
    -   Power supply
