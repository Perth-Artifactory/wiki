-   Who: [SKoT](/User/SKoT), with assistance from Jason & Brett
-   Materials: The plastic pipes were sources from [Remida](/Remida), the chipboard pipe-mounting plate was from the Artifactory wood supply.

```
       * Drop Saw (cutting pipes to length)
       * [[rotobot]] (cutting holes in the chipboard pipe-mounting plate)
       * Extremely Large Hammer (banging pipes into holes that were perhaps a little on the small side)
       * Open Office (for calculating a frequency / pitch / length spreadsheet to ensure general Western-Music / MIDI pitch compatibility of the Thong-o-o-phone)
