The Artifactory has a [wide selection of tools](/tools) which cover the majority of member needs.

This policy applies when a member wants to bring in their own tools ("BYO tools") to use at the space.

## Tool categories

Low Risk 游릭, Medium Risk 游리, and High Risk 游댮 are defined in the [Training](/docs/policies/training) policy.

## Casual / Day Pass users

In most circumstances Casual / Day Pass users are not allowed to BYO tools. Exceptions may be made to facilitate specific events and activities (e.g. Women's Woodworking, Arduino U) by a member of the Management Committee or relevant event host.

The casual attendee will be treated as a member for the purposes of this policy, all other restrictions still apply.
Exceptions are once off (for that specific instance of the event) and do not carry over to other events or days.

## Low Risk tools 游릭

* Members can BYO tools that we classify (or would classify) as Low Risk 游릭 tools.
* If a member is not 100% certain that their tool is Low Risk 游릭, they should seek advice from a member of the [Management Committee](/docs/committee/home) or the [Infrastructure Subcommittee](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructurev2).
* Mains-powered tools must have been tested and tagged within the last 6 months.

## Medium Risk 游리 and High Risk 游댮 tools

* For a member to BYO a Medium Risk 游리 or High Risk 游댮 tool of a type covered by an [Artifactory tool induction](/docs/policies/training), the member must be an Artifactory authorised operator for that same type of tool.
* The member must justify why the tool needs to be BYO instead of using the equivalent Artifactory tool.
  * This justification must be approved by a trainer who is authorised to train on the equivalent Artifactory tool.
* Tools that we would classify as a Medium or High Risk tool, but which are **not** covered by an Artifactory tool induction, cannot be used without approval from a member of the [Infrastructure Subcommittee](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructurev2).
* Mains-powered tools must have been tested and tagged within the last 6 months.
* A member can authorise themselves to BYO a tool if they would otherwise be authorised to do so under this policy.

## Record keeping

Approved BYO tools must be recorded in a place that is visible to all delegated approvers (e.g. a Slack channel.)

The record must include -

* What the tool is, and who's bringing it in
* The justification for why the Artifactory equivalent isn't appropriate
* Whether the attendee required a casual user/day pass exception
* Whether the tool required an Infrastructure Subcommittee authorisation
* The timeframe of the authorisation (members only)
