**Dangerous projects must be approved by at least two members of the committee.**

Before you work on a project at the Artifactory, you must assess if your project could:

* Kill, injure, or otherwise impact on the **health and safety of any person**.
* Damage **property**, **premises**, or the **environment**.
* Damage the Artifactory's **reputation in the community** - i.e. our social license to operate.

You must demonstrate to the committee that:

* You have the appropriate skills, knowledge, and qualifications to both a) safely, and b) legally, work on the project.
* You have identified hazards, and implemented controls, to achieve an acceptable level of risk.

The committee may require you to submit a formal risk assessment, in writing, before approving your project.

## What projects do we consider dangerous?

Danger comes in many forms, a **non-exhaustive** list has been included below to help you gauge and understand what we consider dangerous. If you are unsure whether your project is considered dangerous please reach out via #general on Slack or via [email](mailto:committee@artifactory.org.au).

### Electrical

* Voltages over 50V AC or 120V ripple-free DC[^1]
* Current exceeding 10A
* Intentional electrical arcing
* Stored electrical energy (capacitors, inductors) with the potential to discharge into people
* Welding batteries (e.g. spot welding lithium-ion batteries)

*Note:Commercial devices are excluded from this category provided that you aren't modifying the device or wiring it yourself.*

[^1]: Anything greater than AS3000 extra low voltage

### Pressurised gases/liquids

* Any system over 20 PSI where fittings are not commercially crimped or vessels are not certified for the expected pressure.
* Any system over 145 PSI

### Temperature

* Expected temperatures of solids are less than -20째C or greater than 200째C
* Expected temperatures of liquids are less than -50째C or greater than 100째C

*Note: These limits do not apply to 3D printers*

### Fire

* Flammable gases
* Open flames

### Radiation

* Lasers greater than Class 3R[^2]
* Artificial UV light less than 300nm
* Microwave radiation outside of a properly functioning microwave appliance
* Radioactive material
* Ionising radiation

### Chemical

* Substances with the ability to cause harm when exposed to skin or eyes
* Materials that react in a highly exothermic manner when exposed to water (e.g. alkali metals like elemental sodium/potassium)
* Bromine and other volatile toxic liquids
* Large quantities of gases (Where the quantity is high enough to adversely affect breathing)

### Mechanical/Gravity

* Suspended loads with the potential to fall on people or cause crush injuries
* Springs with the potential to cause injury
* Exposed fast moving parts
* Projectiles

### Noise

* Hazardous noise [^3]

### Weapons

* Controlled weapons or edged weapons as defined in relevant legislation[^4]

## Prohibited projects

The following types of projects are absolutely prohibited:

* Prohibited weapons and firearms as defined in relevant legislation[^4][^6]
* Accessories for prohibited weapons and firearms
* Drugs
* Fractal burning / Lichtenburg burning[^5]
