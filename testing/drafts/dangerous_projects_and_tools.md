(This is a draft.)

| Hazard | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Mechanical | Projectiles<br><br>Rotating equipment<br><br>Stored mechanical energy - springs |
| Gravity | Suspended loads<br><br>Working at heights |
| Chemicals | Flammable, combustible, or explosive materials<br><br>Toxins<br><br>Chemical reactions, highly reactive substances |
| Electricity | “High voltage” (anything exceeding extra-low voltage: “50 V a.c. or 120 V ripple-free d.c.”)<br><br>High current<br><br>Stored electrical energy - capacitors, inductors |
| Pressure | Pressure vessels<br><br>Liquids or gases under pressure<br><br>Pneumatics, hydraulics |
| Temperature | Hot works<br><br>Open flames<br><br>High temperature processes (furnaces, ovens…)<br><br>Molten materials<br><br>Cold materials (e.g. liquid nitrogen) |
| Radiation | Lasers<br><br>Focused or high-intensity light sources<br><br>UV<br><br>Microwaves<br><br>Radioactive materials<br><br>Ionizing radiation |
| Noise |     |
| Biological |     |

# Dangerous tools

Some tools at the Artifactory, such as the laser cutters and the mill, are inherently dangerous.

You must be trained, deemed competent, and authorised before you use these tools.

If you are bringing your own tools to the Artifactory, you must assess if the tools could pose a risk to people or property.

# Our priorities

Our priorities are:

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
| People | The health and safety of people is our top priority. |
| Property | Protecting our property and premises. |
| Community | Protecting our reputation in the community - i.e. our social license to operate. |

*(Editor's note: Usually the acronym would be “HSEC” and would include environment.)*

# Dangerous projects

**Dangerous projects must be approved by the committee.**

Before you work on a project at the Artifactory, you must assess if your project could:

-   Kill, injure, or otherwise impact on the **health and safety of any person**.
-   Damage **property,** **premises, or the environment**.
-   Damage the Artifactory's **reputation in the community**.

You must demonstrate to the committee that:

-   You have the appropriate skills, knowledge, and qualifications to both a) safely, and b) legally, work on the project.
-   You have identified hazards, and implemented controls, to achieve an acceptable level of risk.

The committee may require you to submit a formal risk assessment, in writing, before approving your project.

## Risk management

Training is beyond scope of this policy.

However some things to consider below.

### Untrained personnel

The Artifactory is a shared space

### Dangerous things generally

### Electricity - high voltage / high current

# Prohibited projects

The following types of projects are absolutely prohibited:

-   Weapons
-   Drugs
-   [Fractal burning / Lichtenburg burning](https://www.woodturner.org/Woodturner/Woodturner/Resources/Safety-Materials/Safety-Fractal-Burning-Lichtenburg-Burning.aspx#:~:text=Fractal%20burning%20has%20killed%20and%20could%20kill%20you.&text=The%20American%20Association%20of%20Woodturners,in%20all%20of%20its%20publications.).
