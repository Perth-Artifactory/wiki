The Artifactory cannot exist without the support of our community and donations are a big part of that support. We appreciate all donations of material, equipment, and funds put towards supporting our aims. In recognition of the impact we have on the community the Australian Tax Office has endorsed us[^1] as a Deductible Gift Recipient. This means that gifts you give to The Artifactory after **August 29th 2023** may be tax deductible.

## What is tax deductible?

> Information in this section has been tailored to the types of gifts we receive and cannot practically be applied to other DGRs. You should consider seeking independent legal, financial, taxation or other advice to check the accuracy of this information and how it relates to your unique circumstances.

Gifts are things you give to the Artifactory with no expectation of getting anything personally in return. For this section monetary donations assume a value of at least $2.

Tax deductible items include[^2]:

* Monetary donations for buying equipment and improving infrastructure in the space (Primarily through [PledgeBot](slack://app?team=T0LQE2JNR&id=A02KPH5PJUE) where indicated)
* Monetary support towards [sponsored membership funds](https://artifactory.org.au/free_membership) (provided you are not a recipient of one of these funds)
* Monetary donations where no set purpose has been outlined
* Donations of equipment and material that were purchased within the last 12 months
* Donations of equipment and material currently valued at over $5,000

Things that benefit you personally are not gifts, and are not tax deductible, including:

* Membership fees
* Event admission fees
* Tool usage fees
* Things you buy while in the space, e.g. food and drinks, supplies for making things

## Where to send monetary donations

> Due to technical restrictions invoices issued by us will always include the bank details for our primary operations account regardless of whether the invoice is a gift. Please disregard that payment information when transferring a gift covered by this page.
{.is-info}

We are required[^3] to maintain a separate account for gifts given to the association. The details for this account are:

Name: `Perth Artifactory Inc Gifts`
BSB: `XXX XXX`
Account: `XXXX XXXX`

## Who can determine whether specific equipment or material support our aims

* For existing equipment and material: Any member of the [Management Committee](/docs/committee/home#committee-members) or [Infrastructure Subcommittee](/docs/infrastructure/infrastructurev2) may accept donations on our behalf. Please do not purchase these items with the express intent of gifting them before talking to us first.
* For proposed equipment/material (PledgeBot): Any member of the [Management Committee](/docs/committee/home#committee-members) can determine that a project is covered. This will be denoted by this line attached to the specific project:

> Donations to this project are considered gifts to Perth Artifactory Inc and are tax deductible.

## How do I claim a tax deduction?

Our treasurers can issue you a receipt[^4] for any tax deductible gifts you give to The Artifactory.

This process is automatic for donations made through PledgeBot but may need to be [manually initiated](mailto:treasurer@artifactory.org.au) for other donations.

For donations of equipment exceeding $5,000 we will also supply you with the appropriate certificate of donation.[^5]

You can use these documents as evidence when claiming tax deductions on your tax return.
