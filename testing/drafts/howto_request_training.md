Follow this guide to request training and inductions (including New Member Inductions) via our Slack #training_and_inductions channel.

These instructions assume you already have Slack (our communications app) set up. Please reach out to info@artifactory.org.au if you need help setting this up.

> Please always post your request as a reply to an existing post. 
>
> If there isn't a training post for the day you want, please be patient! The training posts are done manually by volunteers.
>
> Please don't post directly to the #training-and-inductions channel, as that sends notifications to everyone in the channel (500+ people.)
