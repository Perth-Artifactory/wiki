# Scope

This is a guide for how to run the space during our regular workshop events, e.g. General Hacking Day, Metal Monday, Wednesday Woodworking.

# Priorities

> It's not possible to please everyone all the time.
>
> **It's OK to say "no"** and disappoint people if you can't meet a request safely, or you need to manage your workload as an event host.
>
> Use the priorities below to guide your decision making.
{.is-warning}

1. Safety and protection of (in order) -
    * People (members, visitors).
    * Property and premises.
    * Our reputation / social license to operate.

2. Supervising the operation of the space.
    * Monitoring the activities in the space (e.g. being generally aware of who is doing what.)
    * Checking (where required) that people are trained, competent, and authorised to use tools and equipment.
    * Answering questions about space policies and procedures.
    * Recognising and intervening in unsafe situations.

3. Helping our members.

4. Helping day pass users, the general public.

# Responsibilities

* Open the front door(s) at the **calendared start time of the event**.
    * Let people know if you're going to be late, e.g. by posting to #general.
    * If there's another key holder in the space, you can ask them to open the doors before you get there (so people aren't waiting outside).

* Supervise people in the space as per [Keyholder Responsibilities](/docs/policies/keyholder_responsibilities).

* An event host needs to be present for the **entire calendared duration of the event**.
    * If you need to leave, **hand over to another event host**.
    * *"I need to duck down to Bunnings for some screws - can you please take charge of the space until I'm back?"*

* Close the space at the calendered end time of the event, as per [Keyholder Responsibilities](/docs/policies/keyholder_responsibilities).

# Drop-ins, visitors, people wanting tours, etc.

Refer to [How to give a tour](/testing/drafts/howto_tour) (currently in draft).
* See especially the section regarding "**Specific things that we need to set expectations about**".

# People wanting to use tools (who haven't been trained)

> It is OK to say no to requests that come without prior notice.
>
> We would rather disappoint someone and say "no", than deal with the consequences of unsafe tool use.
{.is-warning}

### First preference: Train the user so they can use the tool without further supervision.
* If you are a **competent and authorised trainer** for the tool, and you have **spare time**, you can train them on the spot.
* Otherwise, ask them to schedule a training slot in #training-and-inductions.

### Second preference: Find an alternative way of doing the job.
* Explore other ways to do the job within the set of tools the person is allowed to use.

### Third preference: Provide direct personal supervision of the tool use.
* If **you** are a **competent and authorised operator** you can provide direct personal supervision while the person is using a tool.
* **This is a big commitment of time and attention, you are under no obligation to provide this level of service.**
* **Direct personal supervision** means that you are physically present and able to intervene during critical phases of operation.
    * It's usually OK to let the person set up the machine themselves, with the machine power off.
    * Tell the person that you need to check their setup and PPE before they turn on the machine.
    * **You need to be physically present and able to intervene while the machine is running.**
    * It's OK to let the person clean up by themselves, with the machine power off.
* You are ultimately responsible for all aspects of the tool use, including setup, operation, and cleanup.

### Fourth preference: Provide general supervision and manage the work area.
* If you are not a competent and authorised operator, you don't have the knowledge required to provide full supervision of the tool use.
* **Generally now is a good time to politely tell the person that we can't meet their request today.**
* However, if the person is qualified in their own right (e.g. a boilermaker with 30 years welding experience wants to use our welders), you can provide **general supervision and manage the work area.**
    * **General supervision** means that you check the person knows how to use the tool in general. For example, if they are welding, watch and check that they confidently put on the required welding PPE, and that they confidently set up and adjust the welding machine.
    * **Manage the work area** means that you create a safe environment for them to use the tool. For example, if they are welding, you would ensure appropriate measures are in place to control the risk from hot works (e.g. removing flammable material, making sure fire extinguishers are available.) You would also implement controls to manage hazards to bystanders, e.g. placing welding screens so that people aren't exposed to welding flash.
* You are ultimately responsible for all aspects of the tool use and any consequences that arise.
    * **If you aren't comfortable that the risk is at an acceptable level - politely tell the person that we can't meet their request today.**

# People who just want to 3D print or laser cut one thing

You can offer to run the job for them in return for payment.
