# Scope

This is a guide for how to run the space during our regular workshop events, e.g. General Hacking Day, Metal Monday, Wednesday Woodworking.

# Priorities

> It's not possible to please everyone all the time.
>
> **It's OK to say "no"** and disappoint people if you can't meet a request safely, or you need to manage your workload as an event host.
>
> Use the priorities below to guide your decision making.
{.is-warning}

1. Safety and protection of (in order) -
    * People (members, visitors).
    * Property and premises.
    * Our reputation / social license to operate.

2. Supervising the operation of the space.
    * Monitoring the activities in the space (e.g. being generally aware of who is doing what.)
    * Checking (where required) that people are trained, competent, and authorised to use tools and equipment.
    * Answering questions about space policies and procedures.
    * Recognising and intervening in unsafe situations.

3. Helping our members.

4. Helping day pass users, the general public.


# Event host responsibilities

* Open the front door(s) at the **calendared start time of the event**. (or before)
    * Let people know if you're going to be late, e.g. by posting to #general.
    * If there's another key holder in the space, you can ask them to open the doors before you get there (so people aren't waiting outside).

* Supervise people in the space as per [Keyholder Responsibilities](/docs/policies/keyholder_responsibilities).

* An event host needs to be present for the **entire calendared duration of the event**.
    * If you need to leave, **hand over to another event host**.
    * *"I need to duck down to Bunnings - can you please take charge of the space until I'm back?"*
    * The role of "event host" is a position of responsibility, and requires specific competencies.
      * Many keyholders do not want to, or are unable to, take on the responsibility of being an event host.
    

* Close the space at the calendered end time of the event, as per [Keyholder Responsibilities](/docs/policies/keyholder_responsibilities).

# Drop-ins, visitors, people wanting tours, etc.

Refer to [How to give a tour](/testing/drafts/howto_tour) (currently in draft).
* See especially the section regarding "**Specific things that we need to set expectations about**".
* If all volunteers are busy, it's OK to ask people to come back for tours at another time (e.g. Open Day).


# People who just want to 3D print or laser cut one thing

You can offer to run the job for them in return for payment.

See [one off jobs](/testing/drafts/howto_tour#one-off-jobs) (currently in draft).


# People wanting to use tools (who haven't been trained)

> It is OK to say no to requests that come without prior notice.
>
> We would rather disappoint someone and say "no", than deal with the consequences of unsafe tool use.
{.is-warning}

### First preference: Train the user so they can use the tool without further supervision.
* If you are a **competent and authorised trainer** for the tool, and you have **spare time**, you can train them on the spot.
* Otherwise, ask them to schedule a training slot in #training-and-inductions.
* Ensure the trainee understands that the reliable way to get training is to make a booking in advance.

### Second preference: Find an alternative way of doing the job.
* Explore other ways to do the job within the set of tools the person is allowed to use.

### Third preference: Provide direct personal supervision of the tool use.
* If **you** are a **competent and authorised operator** you can provide direct personal supervision while the person is using a tool.
* **This is a big commitment of time and attention, you are under no obligation to provide this level of service.**
* **Direct personal supervision** means that you are physically present and able to intervene during critical phases of operation.
    * It's usually OK to let the person set up the machine themselves, with the machine power off.
    * Tell the person that you need to check their setup and PPE before they turn on the machine.
    * **You need to be physically present and able to intervene while the machine is running.**
    * It's OK to let the person clean up by themselves, with the machine power off.
* You are ultimately responsible for all aspects of the tool use, including setup, operation, and cleanup.

### Fourth preference: Politely defer the request

* If we don't have any competent people available to help, you'll need to politely ask the user to come back another time.
* Some users will say they have "heaps of experience" and ask if they can use a tool "just this once" without going through our training procedure.
  * Some users over-estimate their own ability (Youtube is not a substitute for our training and induction system.)
  * Some users hold trade qualifications, however little actual experience, or their experience is from a different country with much lower standards.

> At the end of the day, remember we have a training and induction system for a good reason - so that attendees don't hurt themselves, each other, or our equipment.
>
> Don't let attendees bypass our training system!
