# Preliminaries

* Tours are a 2-way process - you need to ask what people want to do, before you give the tour.
* There are some types of project or usage that we don't support.
  * See *"Specific things we need to set expectations about"* below.
  * Politely and firmly inform people of of our limitations when relevant.
  * **It is OK to disappoint people sometimes.**
* It's OK if you're asked a question and don't know the answer.
  * For any questions you don't have **confident** answers to, it's OK to defer to a more experienced volunteer e.g. a committee member.
* The script below is a guide.
  * You can do things in any order so long as you touch on all the main points.
  * You can skip any content that the visitor already knows about.

# Ingredients of a good tour

## At the start of the tour

* **Put on your name badge**
  * (Ask Lewis if you don't have one yet.)
* **Introductions**
  * Say your name
  * Ask for visitors names
* ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ **Ask visitors what they are interested in and why they are here!** ðŸš¨ðŸš¨
  * Focus the rest of your tour on what the visitor has expressed interest in.
  * Look out for any of the *"Specific things we need to set expectations about"* below.
  * If they want to do a thing which we don't allow (e.g. van fitouts) - firmly and politely tell them that we aren't able to accomodate their project.
    * *"Sorry, we don't allow van fitout projects for new members. I'm happy to keep showing you around, but I'm also happy if you want to get on with the rest of your day."*

## Introduce the space

* **Ask how much they already know about us.**
  * Skip anything they already know.
* **Community shed**
  * We are a community shed (like a men's shed, but more inclusive and cooler!)
  * Our mission is to enjoy making things as part of a community.
  * We are equal parts community (place where you hang out) and workshop (place where you use tools).
* **Not for profit**
  * We are a not-for-profit (charity) run entirely by volunteers.
  * We are supported entirely by membership fees and donations. We have no government funding of any kind.
  
## Introduce key policies

* Code of Conduct and Training policy posters are at the front door.
* **Code of Conduct**
  * Touch on the main pillars of the Code of Conduct
  * The goal is to establish that we **have** a Code of Conduct, and that we value it highly.
* **Training policy**
  * Touch on the main points of the training policy.
  * The goal here is to establish that we both a) provide training where needed, and b) require training before using certain kinds of tools.
  * Explain that training on certain tools (e.g. 3D printers, CNC router) is members only.
  * Explain that all training is "paid for" by volunteering to do tasks off the whiteboard.
  
## Walk around the space and look at things

* Walk and talk through the space looking at things
* Some things to touch on (as you walk around the space in a general clockwise path.)
  * Metal area - mill and lathe training is for members only.
  * 3D printers - training is for members only.
  * Social table is a NO PROJECTS zone (don't mix food with projects.)
  * Toilets, kitchen facilities, first aid.
  * Bar - EFTPOS payments - self service. (We have no staff - We rely on an honesty system.)
  * Outside courtyard area - messy work.
  * Lasers area - laser scrap is free to use for PERSONAL PROJECTS.
  * As you pass the tool wall - look at sticky tape etc. Explain that consumables are donated on a "give back about as much as you use - replace when it runs out" basis.
  * Hack rack - Free for MEMBERS to use for PERSONAL PROJECTS. No need to hoard - there will always be things on the hack rack.
  * Machine room - CNC router - show the example piece (CNC routed map of Rottnest Island.) Training is members only.
  * Project area. Explain that member storage (pallet racking) is for members only.

## Closeout Pt.1 - Slack

* Explain Slack
  * "It's Facebook Messenger or Discord, but for businesses"
  * Explain that we use Slack for everything, and any questions are best asked on Slack.
  * Show them the Slack signup link (On our main website artifactory.org.au - scroll down to "Join our Online Community.)
  * If necessary, walk them through installing Slack and setting up an account.

## Closeout Pt.2 - Membership sales pitch

* Explain that there are 2 ways to use the space.
* **1 - as a Day Pass / casual user.**
  * Recommended while people are figuring out if the space is for them.
  * Limited assistance and training available.
  * Visitor signup is required (https://perart.io/visitor) - to accept our terms and conditions of attendance, and to create a training record.
* **2 - as a member.**
  * $75/mo Full, $45/mo Concession.
  * Supports the space and helps us pay our bills.
  * More assistance and can be trained on all tools.
  * Can apply for 24/7 access, subject to further requirements.
* **Explain how to sign up.**
  * Go to our main website (artifactory.org.au)
  * Click on the big red button "Become a Member".
  * This will take them to TidyHQ to input personal details and PAYMENT INFO FOR THEIR **FIRST MONTH** OF MEMBERSHIP.
* **Explain the membership signup workflow.**
  * Sign up on TidyHQ.
  * Pay for your first month.
  * Attend a New Member Induction (show them how to respond to the #training-and-inductions posts in Slack.)

## After the tour

* Ask if they have any questions about the space.
* Tell them they're free to wander around, look at things, and talk to people. (There is no charge for looking and talking.)
* Refer questions to more experienced volunteers if needed.

# Specific things we need to set expectations about


## Automotive projects

> Refer to the [Automotive Projects](/docs/policies/automotive-projects) bylaw.
{.is-info}


e.g.

* "I want to service my car"
* "I want to work on my suspension system"

Automotive projects are not routinely supported at the space.

* The space has no facility to dispose of dangerous goods, e.g. used oil.
* Anything that involves someone being under a car (e.g. jack stands) is a high risk activity for us.

People whose sole interest is automotive projects should instead be referred to [DIY Garage](https://www.diygaragewa.com.au/), who have that as their core business, and are much better equipped for it.


## Commercial use of the space

e.g.

* "I want to laser cut things for my Etsy store"
* "I'm looking for a space to mass produce candles for my business"
* "I need a place to do risky experiments for my work"

Commercial activity tends to use more space, machine time, volunteer time, safety assessment, and resources than we can reasonably accomodate.

For that reason, all commercial activities using the space facilities need to be assessed on a case by case basis regarding -

* How the activity can be run to avoid impacting the primary use of the space
* How the safety risks associated with the activity will be managed
* How the profits from the commercial activity will be shared with the space

We've found most small business owners are looking for a cheap or free facility to produce their products (instead of renting their own space or buying their own tools), and aren't interested in engaging with us once they find out there are strings attached to commercial use of the Artifactory.


## Consulting services

e.g.

* "I need help designing a product for sale"
* "Do you have any mechanical engineers who can advise me on a project?"

Artifactory members are not a source of free engineering consultancy services.



## Dangerous projects

> Refer to the [Dangerous Projects](/docs/policies/dangerous_projects) policy.
{.is-info}

Dangerous Projects require approval, and can only be done by members.


## Minors (children) in the space

Refer to [Minors in the space](/docs/policies/bylaws#minors-in-the-space).


## NDIS attendees

Refer to [NDIS](/docs/policies/ndis).

NDIS supported participants each have unique needs, and each requires individual consideration.

NDIS related enquiries should generally be directed to Fletcher or Renae.




## Vehicle fit outs (van lifers, etc.)

e.g.

* "I want to build a camper van"

Vehicle fit outs can only be done by members, who have held their membership for at least 6 months.

People doing van fitout projects generally want to use the space very intensively for a short time (e.g. 1 month).

These people usually need a lot of volunteer time for tool inductions, but don't contribute back to our community, and they leave as soon as their fitout project is done.

## People that will need more assistance planning out and completing a project

e.g.

* "I want to build a coffee table, but I don't know any woodworking yet"

This level of assistance is typically only provided to members (not day pass users).

## People who don't (yet) have an actual project in mind

e.g.

* "I want to learn how to use tools" *(gesturing vaguely at entire tool rack)*
* "I'm interested in electronics" *(gesturing vaguely at the electronics bench in general)*
* "Do you run electronics courses?"

People without specific projects have the potential to suck up arbitrary amounts of volunteer training time for broad categories of tools/skills that they don't seriously intend to use.

Some people want to collect skills ("gotta catch 'em all"!) without any intended use case for the tools.

We would encourage these people to start on a specific project, and learn the tools and skills relevant to that specific project. We can't teach someone how to *"do woodwork"*, but we can teach someone *"how to use a mitre saw to cut wood for a picture frame"*.

We will generally only provide training for tools connected to a specific project the person is doing. This increases the chance they will retain the training information, and reduces the demand on volunteer training time.
