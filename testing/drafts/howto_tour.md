- Ask what they want to do at the space

- Ask what they know about us already

- Set expectations regarding -
  - Training requirements
  - Volunteer availability
  - 24/7 access

By the end of the tour you should have a good idea whether someone would be a good fit for our community or not.

Make a decision regarding how hard you want to sell membership etc.

# Specific things we need to set expectations about

If these things come up, 

## People who don't (yet) have an actual project in mind

e.g.

* "I want to learn how to use tools"

## Automotive projects

## Vehicle fit outs (van lifers, etc.)

e.g.

* "I want to use the space while I'm fitting out my camper van"

People doing van fitout projects generally want to use the space very intensively for a short time (e.g. 1 month).

These people usually need a lot of volunteer time for tool inductions, but they usually don't contribute back to our community, and they leave as soon as their fitout project is done.
