So you reckon this Artifactory place sounds kinda cool, here's how we recommend getting started!

## 1. Have a think about a project you might like to complete or an area you're interested in

We recommend adopting a "project first" mentality. Rather than trying to learn everything about a particular tool or area try starting with a project and learning everything you need to create it.

Your first project doesn't have to be super fleshed out, it just gives us a good starting point when you visit. If you've already found something that takes your fancy this step is done!

If you're really not sure we recommend picking an overall area for your first project and exploring resources on YouTube from there. Adding "beginner project" to the following areas may prove fruitful:

* Woodworking
* Metalworking
* Electronics
* CNC Routing
* Laser Cutting
* 3D Printing

These aren't all the areas the Artifactory has to offer but they're some great starting points.

If you're still not sure that's okay too! We can help you spitball ideas.

> Large projects with **tight deadlines** (like a van fitout) do not typically make good first projects. Please discuss these with us first as we are typically unable to adjust our training/access policies to accomodate the quick turnaround required.

## 2. Organise your first visit to the space

Our first visit guide has some great information on when your first visit should be and what you need to do beforehand.

## 3. Read our Code of Conduct

Our code of conduct lets you know how we expect you to behave in our community and gives you an idea of how you can expect to be treated. We do not tolerate bullying, harrassment, or discrimination in any form.

## 4. Visit!

Come check out the workshop, chat with our volunteers, and see if the space is a good fit for you. During your first visit we'll:

* **Ask you about your interests** - We'll use this information to make the next points more interesting and applicable for you!
* **Give you a tour of the workshop** - This will include looking at some of our main tools and facilities.
* **Tell you about events we run** - There's a lot going on and it can be a little overwhelming at first!
* **Help you decide whether your intended project(s) can be achieved at the Artifactory** - We want to make sure that you get the most out of the space.

## 5. Decide whether you want to join

This is the first actual decision you need to make. You can either use the space as a casual attendee (Day Pass) or join our community as a member. Here are some of the key differences:

|                                                                                            | Day Pass | Member |
| -                                                                                          | -------- | ------ |
| Access to events                                                                           | ✅       | ✅    |
| Training on our smaller tools                                                              | ✅       | ✅    |
| Training on our more complex and larger tools                                              | ❌       | ✅    |
| Priority access for inductions and training                                                | ❌       | ✅    |
| Assistance with project planning                                                           | ❌       | ✅    |
| Onsite storage                                                                             | ❌       | ✅    |
| Apply for 24/7 access                                                                      | ❌       | ✅    |
| Reduced tool usage fees                                                                    | ❌       | ✅    |
| The knowledge that you're supporting a community that supports the mental health of makers | ❌       | ✅    |

And a few things to keep in mind when deciding:

* Many areas of the space are set up with members as the priority.
* We are a community first. You'll get the most out of the space if you treat us as such rather than purely a workshop for hire.
* It's okay to start as a day pass user and then move over to a membership once you realise we're the right fit for you.

## 6. Read the new member/visitor guide

Our new members guide will get you acquainted with various aspects of the space. If you intend to utilise a Day Pass check out the visitor guide instead. If you don't understand something in these guides please ask on Slack (see the next step!) or in person.

## 7. Join Slack

If you haven't already now is the time to join Slack, our online communication platform. Everyone is welcome on Slack, it's not members only. We **strongly recommend** setting your name on Slack to the name you want to be referred to in person rather than an online/screen name. If you're comfortable doing so you should set a profile picture of yourself — this will help people put a face to your messages and kickstarts people recognising you in the workshop.

If you decided to sign up as a member an Artifactory logo should appear next to your name within an hour of you joining. Ask in #general if this hasn't happened after 24 hours.

## 8. Read our training/induction policy

Our training policy will give you a good idea of what tools need specific inductions.

We require a 1:1 time committment for training and inductions you receive in the space. This means that if a volunteer spends an hour helping you we expect you to spend *at least* an hour helping out around the space with things like communal cleaning.

> If you have a disability that should be considered during training or when meeting your corresponding volunteering obligations please reach out to our membership officer (Fletcher) to discuss. We will **always** work with you to ensure you are adequately supported.

## 9. Decide which tools you need for your project

We've found it's usually helpful to make a list of all the tools you're going to need to use to complete your project. We have a list that includes many of the tools we have available.

* Members can get in depth answers using the same channels or by organising a time to sit down with one of our volunteers. Remember to check whether your name has an Artifactory logo next to it, this is how we know you're a member.
* Day pass users can get some limited advice by asking in the relevant Slack channel, if you're not sure which channel is appropriate just ask in #general.

## 10. Book a new member induction (Members only)

Our new member induction goes into the nitty gritty of what it means to be a member of our community and is **mandatory for all members**. It is not the same as a tour of the space.

Take a look in #training-and-inductions for upcoming days where new member inductions are being offered. This will typically be Saturday during the day and alternate Wednesday/Monday evenings. If the post listing the day in question isn't in the channel yet please be patient.

Once you've found a time slot that suits reply to the message letting us know you'll be attending.

## 11. Book inductions on the tools you need for your project

Use the instructions from the previous step to book inductions on the tools you need.

| [Visit #training-and-inductions](https://perart.io/Straining) |

## 12. Start attending events and working on your project

Check our event calendar for upcoming events that suit your schedule. It's usually fine to work on projects not related to the event in question. (Woodworking can still be done during Metal Monday for example)

| [Check the calendar](https://artifactory.org.au/events) |

## 13. Work towards 24/7 access (Members only)

A key comes with a lot of trust attached. The best way to earn that trust is to demonstrate that you're a responsible member of our community. This can be done by:

* **Attending events** - Feel free to reach out to our membership officer (Fletcher) on Slack if you're a bit nervous getting started.
* **Completing tool inductions** - One of the best ways for us to get to know you is to see how you use tools close up.
* **Helping out around the space** - Finding things to do is typically covered in your new member induction, ask someone in the space next time you're in if this didn't happen (In short, check the whiteboard). While you'll be doing some things already to meet your volunteer obligations when receiving training we always appreciate any extra time you're able to contribute.
* **Working on projects in a safe and respectful manner** - Meeting the requirement that you work safely and clean up after yourself is best done through action!

Once you feel you've met our requirements (covered in the new member induction) reach out to membership@artifactory.org.au or a committee member in the space.

## 14. Get involved in running the Artifactory itself

* **Help run an event** - Post in #events-and-promotions if you have a new event idea.
* **Contribute towards our fundraising efforts** - From time to time we'll ask for help making things that will be used to fundraise for the space. Keep an eye out in #general or ask a committee member for upcoming opportunities
* **Attend our laser maintenance nights** - Keep an eye on #lasers for this event, it typically runs every 6 weeks.
* **Get involved in an infrastructure build** - Keep an eye out for volunteer callouts for larger projects in #general or ask a member of our Infrastructure team about things that need to be done. Sometimes we have projects that need an extra set of hands, sometimes we need people with particular skills. The infra folk will help direct you as appropriate.
* **Become a tool trainer** - Our standard for trainers is quite high, we will typically approach you if we think you'd be a good fit and we see you around the space frequently.
* **Join one of our subcommittees** - Membership of these groups are largely by invitation. We'll reach out if we think you're a good fit and see you around the space frequently.
