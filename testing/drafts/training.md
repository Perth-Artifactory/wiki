# Training

We classify our tools into three levels based on the potential risk to people and property. Tools are marked with coloured dots to help you identify whether you can use them or not.

You can check whether you're an authorised operator for specific medium and high risk tools by checking the appropriate [Authorised Operator List](/docs/reports/machine_operators).

If we notice you using a tool inappropriately, we’ll still ask you to pause your job and help you identify a safer method.

## Tool Categories

### Low Risk 🟢

You can self assess your competency on these tools and use them if you feel comfortable. Feel free to have a go and if you're not sure you can always ask.

### Medium Risk 🟡

These tools can easily hurt you or others. To use these tools you must either complete a short induction with one of our authorised trainers or demonstrate to them that you can use this tool safely.

### High Risk 🔴

These tools can cause serious injury, are easy to damage, or both. An induction is **required** before using these tools. You must go through the Artifactory’s training on high risk tools, even if you have used similar (or identical) tools elsewhere. Only specific people are authorised to train on specific high risk tools.

## Requesting Training

You can request training in the [#training-and-inductions](https://slack.com/app_redirect?channel=C069Q91GQGY&team=T0LQE2JNR) channel on Slack. Some training for medium risk tools can be conducted ad hoc at the discretion of an authorised trainer. However, most training needs to be booked in advance through Slack. Training for some of our high risk tools represents a significant time investment for our volunteers, and is only available to members. 

### Costs

Training on certain high risk tools has an attached cost. We will refund training costs for people that sign up within 7 days of completing a training that would be free for members.
