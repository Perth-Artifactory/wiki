\*\* Setting up and using \*\*

1.  Apply power
2.  Press VOLTAGE
3.  Key in desired voltage on keypad and press ENTER
4.  Press CURRENT
5.  Key in desired current limit and press ENTER
6.  Connect load to terminals
7.  Press OUTPUT ON/OFF
8.  Display shows output voltage and current

If something goes wrong, press OUTPUT ON/OFF to disconnect the load.

I **STRONGLY** recommend you set the current limit to something safe.

This power supply is very versatile and can do a stack of things including act as a load. If you really want to know how to make it sing and dance, RTFM.
