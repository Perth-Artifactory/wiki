## Manuals

For detailed specifications see: [3455a_dvm_datesheet.pdf](/3455a_dvm_datesheet.pdf)

For detailed operating instructions see [9018-05892.pdf](/9018-05892.pdf)

For a more abbreviated set of instructions see [hp_3455a_operating.pdf](/hp_3455a_operating.pdf)

## Basic Operating Instructions

This is used basically like a big multimeter. For 2 wire measurements the probes are connected to the Volts/2WΩ/4WΩ connectors; red at the top, black at the bottom. (For 4 wire resistance measurements the additional sense probes are connected to the sense terminals immediately to the left.

The function buttons for DC volts, AC volts, 2 wire resistance, and 4 wire resistance will be the most often used.
