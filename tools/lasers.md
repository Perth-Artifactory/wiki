You can use laser cutters to cut a variety of materials[materials](/tools/lasers/materials) with a high degree of accuracy. The Artifactory currently has two laser cutters in operation:

## Big Red

[Big Red](/tools/lasers/bigred) has a cutting area of **1200mm x 885mm** and is great for cutting and larger projects.

## Middle Red

[Middle Red](/tools/lasers/middlered) has a cutting area of **700mm x 500mm** and is great for cutting thin material and precise engraving.

## Training

You must be signed off by one of our laser trainers before you can cut unsupervised. Laser training is split over two sessions and is suitable for all experience levels. In the first session we'll get you comfortable using the machine, and familiarise you with our material and fire safety procedures. Your second session is an assessment. A trainer will watch you go through the cutting process from start to finish and ask you some questions to confirm you understand how to use the machine safely. 

Training is typically booked through the [#training-and-inductions](https://perart.io/Straining) channel on [Slack](https://artifactory.org.au/slack).
