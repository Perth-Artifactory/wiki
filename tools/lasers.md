You can use laser cutters to cut a variety of materials[materials](/tools/lasers/materials) with a high degree of accuracy. The Artifactory currently has two laser cutters in operation:

* [Big Red](/tools/lasers/bigred)
* [Middle Red](/tools/lasers/middlered)

## Training

You must be signed off by one of our laser trainers before you can cut unsupervised. Laser training is split over two sessions and is suitable for all experience levels. In the first session we'll get you comfortable using the machine, and familiarise you with our material and fire safety procedures. Your second session is an assessment. A trainer will watch you go through the cutting process from start to finish and ask you some questions to confirm you understand how to use the machine safely. 

Training is typically booked through the [#training-and-inductions](https://perart.io/Straining) channel on [Slack](https://artifactory.org.au/slack).

### Trainers

These volunteers are able to train laser operators

## Usage Costs

To cover the cost of maintenance, consumables, and power the laser cutters have a [usage fee](/docs/policies/fees#laser-cutter-big-red) attached. Our control software will give you a rough estimate of the time it will take to complete your job.



### Trainers

Below is a list of trainers (Artifactory volunteers who are able to train new operators). Training can be organised by posting a message to the [\#lasers](https://perthartifactory.slack.com/archives/CB9S94S2E) channel on Slack.



### Operators

[Operators List](/docs/reports/Laser_operators) - this is a list of the people who are trained to use each laser cutter.

### Rules

* You cannot look at multiple laser cutters at the same time, this means you cannot operate multiple lasers at the same time.
* Clean up the bed after you are done cutting.
* Closed footwear must be worn at all times in the laser area.
* Do not attempt to open covers or fix issues yourself if you are not qualified to do so. Let #lasers on Slack know.
* Do not slam or force the main door.
* Do not leave the laser cutter while it's running.
* Only use approved materials.
* If you aren't confident performing a particular cut/setup ask for help.
* Remember you're in a shared workspace. This means that:
  * If you have a job that will take an hour and someone else has a 5 minute cut let them go ahead of you.
  * If you NEED to do big 1Hr+ jobs, Try come in at times when the space is less busy.
  * If you change the laser origin change it back when you're done. (Advanced use)
  * Clean up material left around the laser cutters.

### Tips

Pointers and helpful Tips for using the Artifactory Laser Cutters:

* **Corner power on cuts** - For most tasks "corner power" should be set to the same power as that you wish to use for the cut. However, please check this when you're setting up the power settings as a lower power setting here can be the difference between a good cut and a failure. The moving laser head moves fastest in a straight line and can "blow holes" through the corners as it slows down.
* **Don't use red in your drawings** - when you go to load the drawing to cut with lasers, the lines are highlighted red. If you use red you won't be able to tell between your red lines and highlighted lines.
* **Cut from the inside out** - when cutting intricate shapes with holes in the middle, make the inner cuts first. Define a specific layer and move the layer to the top of the operations queue. The material can move, drop or blow around after being cut free.
* **Engrave before cutting** - similar to the above. Engrave items before they have a chance to move
* You can **etch rather than engrave** by using the cut setting with a power level which marks rather than cutting through the material. eg with MDF (any thickness) on the small cutter: try 100% power, 70mm/s speed and 25% corners.
* The **large LC1290 laser** cuts faster and has a longer focus with a deeper cutting area, but may not be able to be fine enough for some engraving jobs.
* The **small LG500 laser** has a shorter focus which works well for fine engraving and thin&intricate cuts. It may not be able to cut all materials that the larger cutter can eat.
* The main software used to create laser cuts are **Aspire** and **LibreCAD**. They are installed on each computer. Any design software that exports DXFs can be used but if you're having trouble getting your files to import correctly run your design through one of these programs.

### Banned Materials

Any material not explicitly listed as safe on the [materials](/tools/lasers/materials) cannot be cut without talking to a laser trainer first.
