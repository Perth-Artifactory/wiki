## Engraving

The following settings should be used as a guide. By decreasing the speed or increasing the power, the engrave can be made deeper.

Little Red has a laser accuracy of 0.1mm, This means that your engrave at 0.01mm will take 10x longer than a **engrave at 0.1mm** (And will look the same), ITs a waste of your time and money. Big Red Is not designed for high detail engraving and you wont get the result like you do on Little Red.

### Special

#### Rubber Stamps

To make a rubber stamp with the laser engraver you need to use the laser-safe engraving rubber (ask [atrophy](/user/atrophy)), you need to use the `Grade Engrave` setting to ablate the material but leave sufficient support material around small features.

**Important: Remember to <span style="color:red;">mirror</span> your vectors before cutting!**
