# Hafco Metalmaster AL-50GA Metal Lathe

Members are responsible for providing tooling and safety equipment for use with the lathe, there is currently a small selection of communal tooling with the lathe but regular users will want to acquire their own tooling.  
  
The lathe is a **very** dangerous tool and is not to be used until you have had a safety induction and basic training by someone on the lathe trainers list below. This is true even if you have used lathes before and is non-negotiable.

* Joshua Rospondek

## Instructions for Use

Work within your capabilities and knowledge, and the machine’s capabilities. If in doubt, ask.

**Reading this list is not a substitute for being trained.**

### Don’t hurt yourself

* Long hair to be tied back. No loose clothing or jewellery.
* Work to be rigidly mounted in the chuck or on the faceplate.
* Tools / toolpost (and tailstock if in use) to be tight.
* Operating the lathe requires the operator’s full attention. Minimise distractions and stop work if necessary.
* Wear appropriate PPE. This includes eye protection and may include ear protection.
* Do not turn materials that are hazardous when inhaled. If in doubt, consult the relevant MSDS.
* Don’t try to clear swarf with your hands. That stuff is sharp!  
* Work with the chuck guard down.
* Don’t leave the chuck key in the chuck.
* Don’t spin the lathe with the chuck jaws un-tensioned.  
* Unplug the lathe when changing speeds or any time the headstock guard is open.
* Mind fingers with belts / pulleys when changing speeds.
* Note that the chuck is screwed onto the spindle. Therefore, do not run the lathe in reverse without a good reason, and if you do, be careful.

### Don’t hurt the lathe

* Keep the tool clear of the chuck.
* Be very careful with power feeding, especially near the chuck.
* Don’t run the lathe with the clutch disengaged, as this is likely to damage the belt.
* Be conservative initially in your choice of feed rate and depth of cut. Work your way up.
* If you stall the lathe, back the tool out immediately. If it doesn’t start moving again do not spin it by hand. Hit the e-stop and start again.
* Use appropriate tooling for the job you are doing.
* The metal lathe is only for use on metals or plastics. For hard materials (e.g. titanium or hardened steel) users must provide their own tooling.

### Be a considerate tool user

* Clean up after yourself. Vacuum or sweep up swarf, including from on the floor.
* Put away lathe tools / tooling you have finished with. Return anything you have borrowed from the general area.
* Don’t remove lathe-specific tools from the machine room.
* If you change chucks, ensure the chuck is done up tight on the spindle and the locking tab is tight.
* Chuck jaws for the 3-jaw chuck are a set. Do not mix them up with other sets.
* When changing jaws in the 3-jaw chuck, insert jaws in the correct order. If you don’t know what this means, ask: don’t try to change the jaws.
* Place damaged / worn out tooling in the receptacle provided.
* Notify \#tools_and_fabrication on Slack of any problems.

### Get good results

(highly simplified!)

* Make sure your tool is at the correct height, i.e. at the centreline of the lathe.
* Respect the limits of the machine – high speed means low torque and vice versa.
* Lathes work best when making a decent-sized chip. It is possible to get a lousy cut by being too timid.
* Understand the basic lathe operations – turning, facing, drilling, boring, parting off – and develop a strategy for your piece before you start.
* Keep your work rigid. Minimise the amount sticking out of the chuck, and use the tail stock to support the work if possible.
* Remember everything bends under cutting forces. For precise work, take a final ‘finishing cut’. Measure as you go – don’t rely on the markings on the slides.
* Consider doing some research on cutting speeds, tool selection and tool geometry, as this is too large a topic to effectively summarise.

## Tools

The lathe takes 12mm tools. It has a quick-change toolpost to facilitate easy changing of tools and setting of tool height.

The Artifactory has a small selection of tooling sufficient for basic turning operations. However, long-term users may want to acquire their own tooling. There are a number of brazed-carbide tools of various kinds, but these are of generally poor quality and perform very badly on anything except soft materials. There is also a selection of tungsten carbide insert tooling, which works better most of the time.

## Stock

Bar stock can be obtained in short lengths on the internet (ebay). However this is a relatively expensive way to buy it.

Local suppliers include:

-   [Voest Alpine](https://www.voestalpine.com/highperformancemetals/australia/en/home/products-brands/products/) sell a wide range of specialty steels at very reasonable prices and will cut to length. Higher-carbon steels such as 1045, and alloy steels like 4140, generally machine much better than lower-carbon steels like 1020 and 1030.
-   For basic steel bar stock, Di Candilio Steel City have a wide range of sizes of [CS1030](http://www.interlloy.com.au/our-products/bright-steels/1030-bright-carbon-steel-bar/) from 10mm dia up. CS1030 is a cold-drawn medium-strength steel that is somewhat machinable and relatively cheap: 20mm bar is \$80 + GST for a full 6m length at the time of writing. Di Candilio will cut to any length you want for a small additional cutting charge.
-   Robert Cameron and Co have a variety of non-ferrous metals (e.g. brass and aluminium) and will cut to length. They don't really have any meaningful web presence at the time of writing but they respond to e-mails and answer the phone. Pricing as at mid-2020 is shown below.
-   Austral Wright seems to be the ultimate wholesale source of brass in WA. Their pricing is \~25/kg, which is not much more than half what you pay from ebay, excluding shipping. That translates as \$93 for a 3.6m length of 1/2" brass. The rub though is that up to \~25mm they only sell in full lengths. For larger sizes (say 50mm) they sell in 500mm increments.

## Resources

The [Blondihacks Lathe Skills series on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLY67-4BrEae9Ad91LPRIhcLJM9fO-HJyN) is a great place to learn about working on a small lathe.

## Notes

Replacement drive belts (the thin one that snaps from time to time) can be had from Machinery House for \$31. It's a GATES 5M710 poly V-belt

The lathe appreciates some lubrication, but try to keep the oil off the belts!
