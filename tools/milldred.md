# MïllDřéd

<img src="/tools/milldred_01.jpg" class="align-left" width="300" alt="milldred_01.jpg" /> MïllDřéd is the Artifactory's CNC heavy milling machine capable of machining pretty much anything conceivable given the right tooling.  
  
:!: MïllDřéd is a **very** dangerous tool that is capable of severely damaging both itself and anyone using it if used improperly, as such it is not to be used until you have completed the safety induction and been trained in its use.

## Pronunciation Guide

For some reason, MïllDřéd has acquired a pseudo-persona of a strict eastern european governess. Put on your best/worst Bela Lugosi Dracula accent, and follow: ï as in the ee from “feel”, roll the r in an exaggerated fashion, and a punchy, Marlene Dietrich dismissive “eh” as in “Veak, sqvish-y humans, EH, vaht do dey know of love? (of machining metal)”. The final d should be spat out almost as a t, but still voiced.
