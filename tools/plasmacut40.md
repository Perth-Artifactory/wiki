## Summary

<img src="/tools/toolphotos/plasmacut40/plasmacut40.jpg" class="align-left" width="300" alt="plasmacut40.jpg" /> <s>The Plasma Cutter uses a jet of superheated ionised gas (Plasma) to cut any conductive material up to a thickness of 10mm.  
  
The plasma cutter is a **very** dangerous tool that is capable of severely damaging itself, anyone using it and anyone or anything near it if used improperly, as such they are not to be used until you have completed the safety induction and been trained in its use.</s>

## Instructions for Use

FIXME Ensure that the compressed air tube is connected. Check personal and machine safety. Air will not flow when the machine is turned on, it will begin flowing when the trigger is pressed and will continue until the machine is turned off. It does not stop when the thumb trigger is released! Always be aware of the hot discharged material from the other side of the cut material, this is the main fire and safety danger. Use the welding bench or perform cuts outside if safe to do so. Be careful of cutting through or igniting supports. The material needs a good metal-on-metal ground connection, clean a surface with a grinder or alternate method if necessary. The cutting head also requires a decent metal contact and may be blocked by paint or other coating. Again it should be cleaned beforehand if necessary.
