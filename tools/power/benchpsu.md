# DSE 0—30V 2.5A Lab Power Supply

\*\* Specifications \*\*

-   Output voltage: 0—30 V DC
-   Output current: 2.5A max
-   Load regulation (0-100% load): 10mV
-   Ripple and noise: 5mV RMS
-   Voltmeter accuracy: ±1.0%
-   Ammeter accuracy: ±1.0%
-   Mains overcurrent protection: 1A resettable circuit breaker

\*\* Setting up and using \*\*

1.  With the power supply still turned off, disconnect any loads from its output terminals
2.  Turn the power supply on and turn the voltage control knob until the left LCD displays the desired voltage
3.  If you do *not* need to set a specific maximum current, set turn the current control knob to 'high'; if you *do*, then
    -   set the current control knob to just above 'low',
    -   short the power supply's output,
    -   adjust the current knob until the right LCD displays the desired maximum current, and
    -   remove the short
4.  The power supply is now ready to use

\*\* Warnings \*\*

-   Do not block any of the ventilation holes as this may cause the power supply to overheat
-   Do not use the spring-loaded terminals on the front panel for currents in excess of 1A
