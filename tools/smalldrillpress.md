## Instructions for Use

Always clamp the workpiece!

Remember to select a suitable speed, based on bit size and material. For instructions on how to change speeds, see here: <http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Change-the-Speed-of-a-Drill-Press/>

For appropriate speeds, please consult the following tables:

|                 | Hole size (mm) |        |        |      |      |       |     |     |       |     |

|   Mild Steel    |      1880      | *1370* | *1370* |      | 900  | *900* | 625 | 625 | *625* |     |
|  Medium Steel   |      1370      |        | 900    |      | 625  | *625* |     |     |       |     |
| Aluminium/Brass |                | 2500   |        | 1880 | 1370 | 1370  |     |     | 900   | 900 |

A blank space means that theres no suitable speed available for cutting that size hole. Italics means that the speed listed is close, but not actually in the recommended range.

## Notes

FIXME

Notes from an experienced machinist:

-   base formula for mild steel is 9000/diameter (in mm)
-   Prefer a slower speed than faster
-   This is for general high speed (HSS) drill bits and end mills.
-   Four times faster if using carbide heads, you lucky bastard.
